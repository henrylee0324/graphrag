They are disproportionately impacted by COVID-19, accounting for 33 percent of Michigan's confirmed cases and 40 percent of the state's deaths. This disproportionate impact is not unique to Michigan, as African Americans experience higher infection rates and mortality rates than other groups in the United States.\n\nThe pandemic has also highlighted the racial discrimination and stigmatization that African Americans face, which can exacerbate their vulnerability to COVID-19. Furthermore, African Americans are often subjected to harmful stereotypes and biases that can affect their health outcomes and overall well-being.\n\nHistorically, African Americans have faced similar challenges during times of crisis, such as World War I, economic recessions, and pandemics. These struggles highlight the ongoing struggle with racism and discrimination that they have endured for centuries.\n\nIt is essential to recognize that African Americans are not immune to perpetuating racism towards other groups, including Asian Americans. However, this does not diminish their own experiences of racism and violence, which must be acknowledged and addressed.\n\nIn summary, African Americans are a group of people who have been disproportionately affected by COVID-19 due to systemic racism and discrimination.
