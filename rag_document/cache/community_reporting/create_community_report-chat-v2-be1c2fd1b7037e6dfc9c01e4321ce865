WHO also warns against using terms that associate disease with a specific group of people or a place, which can lead to unintended consequences.\n\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, WHO declared a global health emergency and cautioned against linking diseases to specific locations or ethnicities, as it can perpetuate stigma. The organization has an international policy against naming diseases by location or ethnicity, which is violated by some terminology used during the pandemic.\n\nWHO has called for describing COVID-19 with scientific and neutral language, urging people not to use certain terms related to the disease that may spread negative stereotypes. The organization provides guidelines for naming new human infectious diseases to avoid causing offense to any cultural, social, national, regional, professional or ethnic groups.\n\nIn 2015, WHO published best practices stating that disease names should not include geographic locations, learning from past unintended stigmatization. The organization recommends using the terms 'coronavirus' or 'COVID-19' to avoid spreading negative stereotypes.\n\nWHO tracks global health data, including the Covid-19 fatality rate, and provides guidance on addressing and preventing COVID-19-related stigma.
