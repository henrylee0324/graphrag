This experience of living with constant worry and apprehension is a common reality for many Black individuals. However, it's also important to note that Black people have historically sought refuge and safety in other places. For example, during the era of enslavement in the United States, many Black people escaped to Upper Canada, which they found to be a \"\"safe haven\"\".
