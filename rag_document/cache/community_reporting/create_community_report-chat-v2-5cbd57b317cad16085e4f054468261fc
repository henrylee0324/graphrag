Another example is the case of Chen, an Asian woman who proudly asserts her identity despite facing discrimination and prejudice.\n\nThe entity has also been subjected to hate crimes, including being assaulted by four teenage girls on a bus in the Bronx and being attacked and raped by a group of boys and men in Milwaukee. Furthermore, they have experienced cultural differences and potential discrimination during the pandemic, such as being insulted and expelled from a train in France for wearing a mask.\n\nIn some cases, the ASIAN WOMAN entity has been targeted with specific forms of harassment, including being asked where she's from despite being from California, experiencing microaggressions about Chinese food and culture, and being harassed by a dog owner in Manhattan. Additionally, they have faced bias incidents, such as being punched on West 34th Street by another woman who made anti-Asian slurs.\n\nOne particularly severe incident involved an Asian woman who was severely burned when a racist individual spilled unidentified chemical liquid on her while she was emptying rubbish at her door in Brooklyn, New York City.\",20\r\n2110,\"\"\"DOROTHY KUO\"\"\",\"Here is the comprehensive summary:\n\nDorothy Kuo is a Korean American woman who has been affected by anti-Asian harassment and violence.
