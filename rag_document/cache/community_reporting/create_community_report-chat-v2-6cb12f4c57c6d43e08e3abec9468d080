They have reported 2.3 times more \"\"hate incidents\"\" than men during the pandemic, according to Stop AAPI Hate. This generation of Asian American women is subject to hearing the phrase 'me love you long time' and its connotations of sexual objectification, which perpetuates harmful stereotypes.\n\nAsian American women are disproportionately affected by hate crimes and discrimination, as seen in the Atlanta mass shootings and other incidents. They are also targeted by shooters, as seen in the killings at massage parlors, with implications for their gender and racial identities. In fact, two Asian American women were among the victims of a series of murders in Atlanta, highlighting issues of gender and race.\n\nAsian American women share stories about the sacrifices of their immigrant parents and grandparents, and the resilience required to assimilate in a country where Asians face ongoing harassment and xenophobia. They understand that Robert Long's actions were a result of a culture filled with racialized and sexualized views of them.\n\nThe nail industry is predominantly made up of Asian American women, making them vulnerable targets. NAPAWF supports Asian American women in particular, highlighting their specific experiences with racism and xenophobia. Two Asian American women were verbally harassed by a man shouting racial slurs while walking near St. Petersburg's downtown waterfront, further emphasizing the need for support and understanding.\n\nOverall, Asian American women face a range of challenges, including racism, misogyny, immigration status issues, and discrimination, which can make it difficult to separate the Georgia shooter's apparent misogyny from the specter of racism.\",16\r\n7287,\"\"\"KAO\"\"\",,2\r\n883,\"\"\"IMMIGRANT PARENTS AND GRANDPARENTS\"\"\",,1\r\n2205,\"\"\"U.S. MASS MEDIA\"\"\",\"\"\"U.S. mass media is a concept that perpetuates stereotypes about Asian American women as exotic and feminine objects.\"\"\",1\r\n7896,\"\"\"JEANNE KAPELA\"\"\",,1\r\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,rank\r\n347,\"\"\"STOP AAPI HATE\"\"\",\"\"\"ASIAN AMERICAN WOMEN\"\"\",\"\"\"Stop AAPI Hate tracks hate incidents reported by Asian American women, which are 2.3 times more than those reported by men during the pandemic.\"\"\",205\r\n3187,\"\"\"ASIAN AMERICAN WOMEN\"\"\",\"\"\"WU\"\"\",\"\"\"Wu notes the impact of war on women's options in countries devastated by conflict, highlighting the experiences of Asian American women.\"\"\",41\r\n4433,\"\"\"SHOOTING\"\"\",\"\"\"KAO\"\"\",\"\"\"Kao provided insights on the killings, highlighting the targeting of Asian American women.\"\"\",27\r\n3191,\"\"\"ASIAN AMERICAN WOMEN\"\"\",\"\"\"GRACE KAO\"\"\",\"\"\"Grace Kao provides insight into how Asian American women have been viewed as exotic and feminine objects in U.S. mass media.\"\"\",23\r\n3195,\"\"\"ASIAN AMERICAN WOMEN\"\"\",\"\"\"WILLS\"\"\",\"\"\"Wills identifies with the experiences of Asian American women in the nail industry, feeling targeted and invisible.\"\"\",22\r\n3199,\"\"\"ASIAN AMERICAN WOMEN\"\"\",\"\"\"RACIAL SLURS\"\"\",\"\"\"Two Asian American women were verbally harassed by a man shouting racial slurs while walking near St. Petersburg's downtown waterfront.\"\"\",22\r\n3197,\"\"\"ASIAN AMERICAN WOMEN\"\"\",\"\"\"ROBERT LONG\"\"\",\"\"\"Robert Long is directly involved in perpetuating harmful stereotypes and violence against Asian American women.\"\"\",19\r\n3188,\"\"\"ASIAN AMERICAN WOMEN\"\"\",\"\"\"EILEEN CHENG-YIN CHOW\"\"\",\"\"\"Eileen Cheng-yin Chow discusses the connection between Asian Americans and the six slain women.\"\"\",18\r\n3190,\"\"\"ASIAN AMERICAN WOMEN\"\"\",\"\"\"YIN, ALICE\"\"\",\"\"\"Alice Yin is the author of the article that discusses the experiences of Asian American women with racism and misogyny.\"\"\",18\r\n3193,\"\"\"ASIAN AMERICAN WOMEN\"\"\",\"\"\"JONATHAN RUSSO\"\"\",\"\"\"Jonathan Russo is charged with attacking three Asian American women, including the 65-year-old woman and two other victims.\"\"\",18\r\n3194,\"\"\"ASIAN AMERICAN WOMEN\"\"\",\"\"\"MURDERS IN ATLANTA\"\"\",\"\"\"The murders in Atlanta had a disproportionate impact on Asian American women, who were six out of eight victims.\"\"\",18\r\n3196,\"\"\"ASIAN AMERICAN WOMEN\"\"\",\"\"\"KAO\"\"\",\"\"\"Kao discussed how Asian American women have been viewed as exotic and feminine objects in U.S. mass media and suspected of prostitution from the earliest U.S. immigration restrictions.\"\"\",18\r\n2558,\"\"\"NAPAWF\"\"\",\"\"\"ASIAN AMERICAN WOMEN\"\"\",\"\"\"NAPAWF supports Asian American women in particular, providing resources and action steps to address their specific experiences with racism and xenophobia.\"\"\",18\r\n3186,\"\"\"PAN, DEANNA\"\"\",\"\"\"ASIAN AMERICAN WOMEN\"\"\",\"\"\"Deanna Pan reports on the impact of the Atlanta-area killings on the Asian American community.\"\"\",18\r\n3189,\"\"\"ASIAN AMERICAN WOMEN\"\"\",\"\"\"IMMIGRANT PARENTS AND GRANDPARENTS\"\"\",\"\"\"Asian American women share stories about the sacrifices of their immigrant parents and grandparents, emphasizing resilience and assimilation challenges.\"\"\",17\r\n3192,\"\"\"ASIAN AMERICAN WOMEN\"\"\",\"\"\"U.S. MASS MEDIA\"\"\",\"\"\"Asian American women are portrayed as exotic and feminine objects in U.S. mass media, perpetuating harmful stereotypes.\"\"\",17\r\n3198,\"\"\"ASIAN AMERICAN WOMEN\"\"\",\"\"\"JEANNE KAPELA\"\"\",\"\"\"Jeanne Kapela links violence against Asian American and Pacific Islander women to stereotypes placed on them.\"\"\",17\r\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
