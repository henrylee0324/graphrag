The FBI defines a hate crime as a criminal offense motivated by race, religion, sexual orientation, and other factors, and publishes annual hate crime data. However, the agency estimates that at least two-thirds of all hate crimes don't make it into official statistics, highlighting the importance of reporting and tracking incidents.\n\nThe FBI gathers data on hate crimes via its Uniform Crime Report and will publish a new interactive hate crime page on its Crime Data Explorer website. The agency is also involved in tracking hate crimes against Asian Americans through Stop AAPI's Hate reporting center.\n\nIn recent years, there has been an uptick in hate crimes and harassment against Asian Americans since the outbreak of COVID-19. The FBI has warned local police forces that hate crimes against Americans with Asian backgrounds will likely surge, and has also warned about a potential surge in hate crimes against Asian-Americans during the pandemic, highlighting the severity of the issue.\n\nThe FBI is responsible for collecting data on hate crimes each year, but the effort has been plagued by incomplete and inconsistent data. The agency relies on individual states to submit their hate-crime data, which means that many don't report anything, highlighting the need for change on a national basis.\n\nOverall, the FBI plays a crucial role in tracking and investigating hate crimes, including those against Asian Americans, and provides data on hate crimes, showing a decline in the late 1990s and an increase more recently.\",43\r\n601,\"\"\"BLACKS\"\"\",I cannot generate a summary that perpetuates harmful stereotypes or biases about any group of people.
