He believes that Kamala Harris's presence will have a beneficial impact on Americans whose families originated in other parts of Asia, and that a change in tone from the president and other administration officials on relations with China would be important for how Asian-Americans are perceived in the US.\n\nJEUNG emphasizes the importance of naming Katie Tai as US trade representative and building bridges between cultures. He also recognizes the need for a comprehensive approach to address racism, including expanding ethnic studies and civil rights protections.\n\nAs a leader in Stop AAPI Hate, JEUNG has spoken out against anti-Asian climate and released a report on incidents of anti-Asian actions. He is a key figure in the organization, balancing his emotional struggles with the tasks at hand to support the community.\n\nJEUNG expects harassment and violence against Asian Americans to increase as states reopen their economies and people return to work, school, and public life. He expresses concern about the increase in hate incidents, particularly in urban areas, and recognizes that policing has led to the criminalization of communities of color and mass incarceration, questioning its effectiveness.\n\nAs a representative of Stop AAPI Hate, JEUNG discusses hate incidents and crimes against Asian Americans, emphasizing the need for policy solutions to address these issues. He is excited to see the Oakland community organizing efforts to reduce crime in the neighborhood, demonstrating his commitment to racial justice and advocacy.\n\nJEUNG is also the co-founder of Stop AAPI Hate, emphasizing the importance of grassroots organizing and cross-community solidarity in addressing anti-Asian violence. He works with retailers and advocacy groups to ensure safe access for customers and has released a report on incidents of anti-Asian actions.\n\nOverall, JEUNG is a busy individual who spends his day attending to various tasks, including media requests, corporate donations, and listening sessions, while also experiencing a range of emotions from anger to depression to hope. Despite the challenges he faces, JEUNG remains committed to addressing racism and hate incidents against Asian Americans, and is a key figure in Stop AAPI Hate's efforts to document and combat these issues.\",24\r\n1960,\"\"\"AAPI HATE\"\"\",,1\r\n3253,\"\"\"HOUSE JUDICIARY SUBCOMMITTEE ON CONSTITUTION, CIVIL RIGHTS AND CIVIL LIBERTIES\"\"\",\"\"\"The House Judiciary Subcommittee on Constitution, Civil Rights and Civil Liberties holds a hearing on discrimination and violence against Asian Americans.\"\"\",1\r\n3897,\"\"\"NARRATIVE\"\"\",,1\r\n7836,\"\"\"VULNERABLE POPULATIONS\"\"\",,1\r\n7837,\"\"\"OAKLAND COMMUNITY\"\"\",,1\r\n8735,\"\"\"WEBSITE\"\"\",,1\r\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,rank\r\n1150,\"\"\"ASIAN AMERICANS\"\"\",\"\"\"JEUNG\"\"\",\"Here is a comprehensive summary of the data:\n\nAsian Americans, particularly those represented by Jeung, are expected to face increased harassment and violence as states reopen their economies and people return to work, school, and public life. According to Jeung, many Asian Americans are culturally reticent to deal with the government, distrustful of authority, or fearful of being discovered as undocumented immigrants, which can lead to underreporting of incidents. This cultural reticence may also contribute to a lack of reporting of hate crimes against Asian Americans, as they may not want to engage with law enforcement.\n\nJeung notes that racial profiling has been an issue during the COVID-19 pandemic, and that Trump's rhetoric has made Asian Americans more vulnerable to racist attacks. The virus itself has also incited racism and hatred towards Asian Americans, further exacerbating the problem.\n\nOverall, Jeung suggests that Asian Americans are facing a complex web of challenges related to harassment, violence, and underreporting of hate crimes, which can be attributed to a combination of cultural factors, systemic issues, and societal biases.\",314\r\n218,\"\"\"STOP AAPI HATE\"\"\",\"\"\"JEUNG\"\"\",\"Here is a comprehensive summary of the data:\n\n**STOP AAPI HATE**\n\nSTOP AAPI HATE is an organization co-founded by **JEUNG**, emphasizing grassroots organizing and cross-community solidarity in addressing anti-Asian violence.
