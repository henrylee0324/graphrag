However, they also face challenges in their duties, as research suggests that police officers are more likely to mistakenly shoot an unarmed Black man than an unarmed White man, with the added concern of faster response times. Furthermore, some police officers may prioritize easy solutions over addressing the root issues, potentially neglecting their responsibilities and failing to provide justice to victims.\n\nDespite these challenges, police officers can also be instrumental in helping victims file reports and providing a sense of security. In fact, some police officers, including those from volunteer groups, actively work to stop anti-Asian violence and harassment, demonstrating their commitment to promoting equality and fairness.\n\nIn certain situations, the presence of police officers may even have prevented tragic events like the death of Vicha Ratanapakdee and other attacks on minorities.
