On one hand, it has made economic inroads into the Chinese market by selling wines to China. However, this relationship has also led to tensions, with Australia taking a stance against Chinese state corporations' purchases of Australian assets due to perceived strategic and economic threats.\n\nInternationally, Australia has been urged by China to change course and stop intervening in Hong Kong affairs and China's domestic affairs. This has led to a crisis affecting the country, with Prime Minister Scott Morrison speaking about defending its national sovereignty.\n\nDomestically, Australia is a multicultural nation where people from different backgrounds live and work together. However, this diversity has also been marred by instances of unacceptable race discrimination and xenophobia against Chinese people during the COVID-19 pandemic. In fact, there have been reports of hate crimes against people of East Asian appearance in the country.\n\nDespite these challenges, Australia is a country that acknowledges its own black history and discusses racial discrimination and social injustice. It has also taken measures to address these issues, although some of these actions may be seen as violating international law and basic norms governing international relations.\n\nOverall, Australia is a complex nation with both positive and negative aspects.
