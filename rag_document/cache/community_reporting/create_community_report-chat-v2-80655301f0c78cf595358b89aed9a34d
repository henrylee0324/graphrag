This has led to Asian hate and other forms of discrimination, which can impact its global reputation and societal progress.\n\nThe country has a history of treating marginalized communities poorly, including enslaved Africans and immigrants. Additionally, it is connected to China's industry and urban development through its addiction to cheap technology. The U.S. claims to be a \"\"beacon of freedom\"\", highlighting its significance in the discussion.\n\nBarbara Nguyen-Tran, who resides in the country, has lived in multiple locations within the U.S. Efforts are being made to counter surging Asian hate through various initiatives.
