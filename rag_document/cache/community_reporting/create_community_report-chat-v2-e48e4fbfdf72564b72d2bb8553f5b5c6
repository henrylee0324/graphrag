In 1943, Congress established an immigration quota for China, limiting the number of visas to approximately 105 per year. However, this quota was not limited to China alone, as Congress has failed to allocate sufficient funds to provide healthcare to Indigenous tribes, including the Navajo, Hopi, and Zuni people.\n\nIn recent years, Congress has taken steps to address racial equity by introducing bills that aim to address racial injustice. Additionally, Congress held a hearing on anti-Asian discrimination, marking its first such hearing in over 30 years. This move is seen as a response to the rise in hate incidents targeting Asian Americans and senior citizens.\n\nFurthermore, Congress is set to debate the issue of violence against senior citizens and anti-Asian American hate, considering its response to these incidents. The institution has also been called upon to invest in communities at risk, building for all Americans basic economic rights that include jobs, housing, healthcare, and education.\n\nIn other areas, Congress has been urged to take action on gun reform, with some arguing that the institution needs to \"\"get real\"\" about guns and implement reforms to prevent gun violence. Additionally, Congress played a significant role in bankrupting the early American Republic and delaying the ratification of the Constitution due to issues surrounding the importation of Black people.\n\nOverall, Congress has been involved in a range of activities aimed at addressing various social and economic issues, from immigration and healthcare to racial equity and gun reform.\",16\r\n767,\"\"\"ST.

Additionally, she has pushed for legislation to improve tracking of hate crimes, introducing resolutions to condemn anti-Asian racism as the chairwoman of the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus (CAPAC). Chu has also been vocal about her Republican colleagues' indifference to hate crimes against Asian Americans, criticizing their lack of action in addressing this issue. Furthermore, she has reported that racist attacks on Asian-Americans have surged to about 100 per day, highlighting the urgent need for legislative action and community support. As a leader of CAPAC, Chu has participated in virtual conversations on anti-Asian discrimination and violence, working to raise awareness and promote understanding among her colleagues and constituents.\",5\r\n1372,\"\"\"CHU\"\"\",\"Here is a comprehensive summary of the data provided:\n\n**CHU**\n\nRepresentative CHU, a Democrat, has been actively addressing the rise in anti-Asian American hate and discrimination.

Additionally, it has issued a statement warning against normalizing xenophobic animosity toward Asian Americans by using terms like 'China virus', which can perpetuate harmful stereotypes and fuel discrimination.\n\nFurthermore, the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights has recommended that Congress adopt legislation to provide funding for incentives and called on local police to establish dedicated hate-crime units. This is aimed at combating hate crimes and promoting a culture of inclusivity and respect for all individuals, regardless of their race or ethnicity.\n\nIt's worth noting that not all members of the commission agree on the language used to describe certain issues.
