It is another form of systemic oppression that has contributed to the marginalization of certain groups. This phenomenon is characterized as the action taken based on prejudice or bias, perpetuating systemic racism and inequality. Discrimination refers to the unjust or prejudicial treatment of different groups of people, leading to chronic stress and adverse health outcomes.\n\nIt occurs when individuals are treated differently due to their membership in negatively valued groups, resulting from individual actions or institutional practices. This unfair treatment is based on certain characteristics, such as race or gender, which can lead to a range of negative consequences. Ultimately, discrimination refers to the practice of treating people differently based on their origin, race, religion, sexual orientation, or other characteristics, leading to chronic stress and adverse health outcomes.\n\nI hope this summary meets your requirements!
