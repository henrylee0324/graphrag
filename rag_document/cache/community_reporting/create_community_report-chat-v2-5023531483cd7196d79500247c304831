The location may also be associated with Chinatown, where individuals like the speaker's sister may face racist names and harassment.\n\nThe geographic entity is not limited to a specific location, but can also refer to broader contexts of underrepresentation and discrimination. For example, in America, being Asian can be perceived as a shortcoming, leading to barriers and disparities in care and ability to be healthy.

Additionally, migration stories, like the family's journey from Korea to Canada and back to the United States, driven by economic and professional opportunities, are also relevant.\n\nIn some cases, the geographic entity may not be directly mentioned but can still be inferred through context.
