It is also a neighborhood in San Francisco where Chinese residents live and work, as well as a specific geographic area with a significant Asian-American population. This neighborhood has long been attractive to property owners and developers looking to take advantage of its central location.\n\nCHINATOWN has been resilient in the face of challenges, including COVID-19, but it has also experienced steep declines in business due to the governor's order to close all restaurants for dining in. As the weather gets warmer and people get vaccinated, CHINATOWN is expected to become busier, potentially leading to more hate crimes.\n\nUnfortunately, CHINATOWN has been a location where Asian hate crimes are occurring, including attacks on Asian Americans that have persisted throughout the pandemic. In response, California has set up additional patrols in the area, and groups of volunteers patrol the streets to deter potential attacks and anti-Asian violence.\n\nCHINATOWN is also home to various initiatives and organizations, such as Q Ideas, which is located in CHINATOWN and has been affected by the governor's order.
