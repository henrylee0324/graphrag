Throughout his public statements, he repeatedly referred to COVID-19 as the \"\"China Virus\"\" or the \"\"Kung flu\"\", a characterization that was criticized by Joe Biden's executive order.\n\nThis rhetoric had significant consequences, including increased violence and harassment against Asian Americans amid the pandemic. Trump's initial reference to COVID-19 as the \"\"Chinese\"\" virus perpetuated negative stereotypes against Asian Americans, while his subsequent references contributed to a deep well of anti-Asian racism. His characterization also contributed to the stigmatization of Asian Americans.\n\nFurthermore, Trump's xenophobic language was seen as contributing to the economic devastation caused by COVID-19 in Chinatown.
