WHO received notification from China about COVID-19 at the earliest time possible, demonstrating a cooperative effort between the two entities. The organization has noted that the provision of safe water, sanitation, and hygienic conditions is essential to protecting human health during the outbreak.\n\nWHO is involved in tracing the origin of the virus and conducting global scientific research on COVID-19. The organization provides guidance on combating the spread of COVID-19, highlighting the importance of adequate water, sanitation, hygiene, healthcare waste management, and cleaning in health facilities.\n\nIn response to the pandemic, WHO declared the virus a global public health emergency six weeks prior to Trump's declaration. The organization recommends not naming viruses after regions to mitigate negative impacts on places and peoples. This recommendation is against the use of geographical terms in naming diseases, which Trump's term \"\"Chinese virus\"\" contravenes.\n\nWHO officials are calling for a unified global response to the pandemic, emphasizing the need for international cooperation and solidarity. The organization has published timelines with mutually corroborated facts regarding COVID-19, demonstrating its commitment to transparency and accuracy.\n\nIn summary, WHO is an international organization that plays a crucial role in tracking and responding to global health crises, including the COVID-19 pandemic.
