In recent times, they have conducted several studies and surveys related to anti-Asian sentiment. According to their findings, online hate and harassment against Asian Americans has increased significantly. A survey conducted by the ADL found that 81% of people agree that social media platforms should do more to combat online hate.\n\nThe ADL's research also links Trump's rhetoric to an increase in anti-Asian American sentiment both online and offline. They have published a study on anti-Asian racism, which contributed to the rise in incidents like the attack on the Elderly Korean Couple. The organization has distributed materials with instructions on reporting hate crimes and bias incidents, working to combat anti-Asian sentiment.\n\nThe ADL has also reported a surge in anti-Semitic gibes, cartoons, and conspiracy theories online since the COVID crisis hit. Additionally, they have listed 19 incidents in Maine that did not rise to the level of a crime, up from 16 in 2019. Furthermore, their data shows that anti-Asian sentiment is on the rise, both in scale and quantity.\n\nOne notable finding is that anti-Asian sentiment rose 85% after Trump was diagnosed with COVID-19 last fall. The ADL has also conducted a survey on online harassment and its effects, highlighting the need for increased efforts to combat hate and discrimination.\n\nOverall, the ADL's research and surveys demonstrate a significant increase in anti-Asian sentiment, both online and offline, which is a concerning trend that requires attention and action from society as a whole.\",14\r\n4897,\"\"\"JONATHAN GREENBLATT\"\"\",\"Here is a comprehensive summary of the data:\n\nJonathan Greenblatt, as the CEO of ADL (Anti-Defamation League), has been actively working to combat anti-Asian hate in America.
