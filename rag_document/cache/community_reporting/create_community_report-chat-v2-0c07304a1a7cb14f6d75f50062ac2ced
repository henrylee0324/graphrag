Specifically, anti-Asian racism has reached a crisis point, with over 1,100 hate incidents targeting members of Asian-Canadian communities reported in the past year. This issue needs to be addressed urgently, as Canada is an organization that has recorded increases in hate crimes, particularly against Asian people.\n\nDespite these challenges, Canada is also a country where politeness is not enough to address racism, and where Chinese-Canadians are experiencing racism and feeling unwelcome due to the backlash against China. Racialized migrants are frequently denied landed immigrant status, family reunification, provincial health coverage, unemployment benefits, workplace protections, and other social entitlements and worker protections.\n\nHowever, Canada is also a country that has taken steps to combat the pandemic, including starting a \"\"Together We Win\"\" campaign and receiving a portion of the AstraZeneca vaccine from the USA. Additionally, Canada is home to individuals who have immigrated to the country, such as Simu Liu, who grew up in Etobicoke and Mississauga after moving to Canada from northern China at age five.\n\nIt's worth noting that the crisis point mentioned in the text refers to a growing problem in Canada that needs to be addressed. This issue has been present since Canada became a formal country in 1867, and it is essential for Canadians to come together as one nation to avoid xenophobia during the pandemic.\n\nOverall, Canada is a complex entity with both positive and negative aspects.
