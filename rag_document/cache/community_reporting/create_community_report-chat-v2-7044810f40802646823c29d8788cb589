The incident sparked demands for justice and accountability, as well as calls for police reform and broader change.\n\nFloyd's murder at the hands of a white police officer, Derek Chauvin, who knelt on his neck for nine minutes, was widely condemned and led to nationwide protests and racial abuse. His death exposed long-term tensions between white and black Americans, highlighting the need for equal attention and soul-searching.\n\nThe incident also sparked global reckoning about race and racism, with many calling for recognition, support, and action to stop the targeting of Asian Americans and other marginalized communities. The Black Lives Matter movement was inspired by Floyd's death, as were protests and demonstrations across the United States and globally.\n\nFloyd's brutal death led to increased awareness of hate crimes and xenophobic sentiments, as well as calls for reparations and systemic change.
