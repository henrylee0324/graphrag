Elliott's experiences of bullying began even before he was born, as he has been worried about being harassed and bullied because of his Asian ethnicity since then.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that there are contradictory descriptions provided. Some descriptions suggest that Elliott is the victim of hate crimes, while others imply that he is the perpetrator. Specifically, one description states that Elliott is a person who disagrees with Vilma and the AAPI community's presence in New York, as mentioned by Cato, which could be interpreted as a form of discrimination or racism.\n\nAnother description suggests that Elliott is an individual who was released from prison and is living in a hotel that serves as a homeless shelter, with a history of violent behavior. This description is contradictory to the earlier descriptions of Elliott as a 5-year-old student.\n\nIt is also important to note that one description specifically states that Elliott is not the perpetrator of hate crimes against Vilma and the AAPI community, perpetuating discrimination and racism.
