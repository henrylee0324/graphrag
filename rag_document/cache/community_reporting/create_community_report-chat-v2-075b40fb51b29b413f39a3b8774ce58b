This is not a new phenomenon, as the United States has a long history of anti-Asian discrimination, including the 1882 Chinese Exclusion Act and the internment of Japanese Americans during World War II.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has also exposed underlying issues with racial discrimination, with many people experiencing racist reactions towards Asian Americans. The Stop AAPI Hate organization recorded incidents of anti-Asian discrimination across the United States, showing a significant increase from previous years, with 3,795 incidents reported.\n\nThe country is home to immigrant children being held in detention centers during the pandemic, with the government facing criticism for its handling of the situation.
