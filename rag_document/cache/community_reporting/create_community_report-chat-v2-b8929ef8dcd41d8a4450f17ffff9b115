While it has been in a state of emergency for some time, its beauty lies in its ability to value these principles in addressing the crisis. However, America is also a country that operates on systemic racism and erases the reality of violence supremacy inflicts. This has led to mass shootings, violent attacks on Asian elders, and anti-Asian violence being discussed and addressed.\n\nAmerica is not immune to global issues such as the COVID-19 pandemic, which it has struggled to contain due to inadequate measures taken by some business owners. The country has a history of racism and systemic inequalities that contribute to COVID-19 disparities. This has had an impact on businesses like Chung's, where the owner has been affected by the pandemic.\n\nAmerica is also home to individuals who have immigrated from other countries, such as Ma, who started her life over as a single mother in the USA. The country has criminalized participation in the human experiment for Asian immigrants and their descendants, despite popular majority votes.\n\nDespite its traditional values of freedom and diversity, America is not without its issues. Students are experiencing racism and inequality, and Chinese students like Tie and Li are studying in the host country, where they face challenges such as Sinophobia and restrictions on foreign students.\n\nOverall, America is a complex entity that embodies both beauty and flaws.
