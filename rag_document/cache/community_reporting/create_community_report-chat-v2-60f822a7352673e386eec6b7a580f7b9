According to statistics, they accounted for 33 percent of Michigan's confirmed cases and 40 percent of the state's COVID-19 deaths. This disparity in infection rates and mortality rates highlights the significant impact of the pandemic on this group.\n\nAs a racial group, African Americans have faced historical struggles with racism and discrimination, which has been exacerbated by the pandemic. They are also affected by racial discrimination and stigmatization during this time, further exacerbating their vulnerability to COVID-19.\n\nThe group's racial identity is measured using the Cross Racial Identity Scale (CRIS), highlighting the importance of understanding and acknowledging their unique experiences. Additionally, African Americans have been affected by racism and violence, which serves as a comparison to anti-Asian American incidents.\n\nIt is essential to recognize that African Americans are not immune to perpetuating racism towards other groups, including Asian Americans. However, this does not diminish the historical struggles they have faced with racism and discrimination.\n\nHistorically, African Americans arrived in colonial times, but most were white arrivals from Britain's African colonies in the 1870s. This highlights the complex and often fraught history of their presence in the United States.\n\nThroughout various crises, including pandemics, economic recessions, and wars, African Americans have faced similar calls to prove themselves, emphasizing their ongoing struggles with racism and discrimination.\",17\r\n2777,\"\"\"RACIAL DISCRIMINATION\"\"\",,7\r\n9757,\"\"\"SUSPICION\"\"\",,4\r\n412,\"\"\"CDC\"\"\",\"Here is a comprehensive summary of the data provided:\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is a public health agency that plays a crucial role in tracking the spread of diseases, including the coronavirus outbreak.

In addition to its work on COVID-19, the CDC has also published reports on intimate partner and sexual violence, including data specific to Asian American and Pacific Islander women from 2010-2012.\n\nThe agency is responsible for investigating and responding to outbreaks, such as the one in Chicago. The CDC advises tests only for cases that fit narrow parameters, such as travel to mainland China, which helps to track the spread of the virus. However, the CDC has also faced criticism for its handling of COVID-19, with some arguing that it failed to handle the pandemic appropriately, leading to widespread deaths.\n\nThe CDC provides data on various health-related topics, including pregnancy-related causes and health equity, highlighting biases in the field of infectious diseases. The agency has also released national statistics showing that African Americans accounted for 22.4 percent of deaths from COVID-19 in the United States. Furthermore, the CDC reported a significant increase in depression and anxiety symptoms before and after the pandemic.\n\nThe CDC's website offers good background information on COVID-19 health disparities, providing valuable resources for those seeking to understand the impact of the pandemic on different populations.

While \"\"Black\"\" can be used as an adjective to describe individuals of African descent, it is not interchangeable with \"\"African American\"\". This distinction highlights the significance of using accurate and respectful terminology when referring to this group.\n\nFurthermore, there is a notable lack of representation in the healthcare profession, with African Americans making up only 3% of full-time medical school faculty.
