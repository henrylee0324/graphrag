They also experience health disparities, including high rates of diabetes, which highlights a disparity in health outcomes.\n\nHistorically, Black people were subjected to inferior treatment, such as being forced to sit in the peanut gallery during performances. Today, they continue to face challenges, including voter suppression, with the overwhelming majority of victims being Black people.\n\nIn addition to these systemic issues, Black people are underrepresented in certain fields, such as cardiology, and have been affected by health disparities that result from structural racism. They also do not identify with the term \"\"people of color\"\" due to historical treatment that does not apply to other racial demographics.\n\nReal Estate Agents often target their home showings at Black neighborhoods, highlighting the need for greater diversity in the real estate industry.

This system not only harms health and well-being but also maintains a societal hierarchy that values one race over others.\n\nIn essence, Structural Racism is a multifaceted phenomenon that encompasses the ways in which societal beliefs, customs, and systems interact to create and sustain racial disparities. It is a dynamic process that operates across various levels, including individual, institutional, and systemic, to perpetuate racial inequality.\n\nBy understanding Structural Racism as a system that reproduces racial inequity, we can begin to address the root causes of these disparities and work towards creating a more just and equitable society for all.\",13\r\n4644,\"\"\"STEREOTYPE\"\"\",\"Here is the comprehensive summary:\n\nThe entity \"\"STEREOTYPE\"\" refers to an oversimplified opinion or judgment applied to an entire group of people, lacking individuality.

Additionally, they experience health disparities resulting from structural racism, leading to cumulative and chronic adverse outcomes.\n\nWhile the term \"\"People of color\"\" is a broad description of individuals who are not white, it can be overly vague and have connotations that may not accurately represent all racial demographics. To address these issues, people of color work with their peers in caucus settings to address internalized racism, heal, and work towards liberation.\n\nOverall, the \"\"PEOPLE OF COLOR\"\" entity is a complex and multifaceted group that requires understanding and acknowledgment of their unique experiences and challenges in order to promote equality and justice.\",7\r\n4543,\"\"\"COLOR-BLIND RACISM\"\"\",\"Here is a comprehensive summary of the data:\n\n**COLOR-BLIND RACISM**\n\nColor-Blind Racism is an ideology that perpetuates racial discrimination and inequality, despite ignoring race as a factor.

This has led to Hispanic people being disproportionately represented in the prison population.\n\nIn addition to these social and economic challenges, Hispanic people also experience health disparities. Statistics show that they face disproportionately high rates of obesity, highlighting a pressing concern for their overall well-being.\n\nFurthermore, there is a need for increased representation and diversity in certain fields, such as cardiology, where Hispanic people are underrepresented. This highlights the importance of specifying racial background in research and data to better understand and address the unique needs of this group.\n\nOverall, \"\"HISPANIC PEOPLE\"\" face a range of challenges that require attention and action to promote greater equity and inclusion.\",5\r\n2060,\"\"\"TAKASAKI\"\"\",\"Here is a comprehensive summary of the data:\n\nTAKASAKI is a researcher who has extensively studied the impact of structural racism on Asian Americans' access to basic resources, as well as the effects of the pandemic on Asian workers and institutional inequities.
