In 1943, Congress established an immigration quota for China, limiting the number of visas to approximately 105 per year. However, this quota was not limited to China alone, as Congress has failed to allocate sufficient funds to provide healthcare to Indigenous tribes, including the Navajo, Hopi, and Zuni people.\n\nIn recent years, Congress has taken steps to address racial equity by introducing bills that aim to address racial injustice. Additionally, Congress held a hearing on anti-Asian discrimination, marking its first such hearing in over 30 years. This move is seen as a response to the rise in hate incidents targeting Asian Americans and senior citizens.\n\nFurthermore, Congress is set to debate the issue of violence against senior citizens and anti-Asian American hate, considering its response to these incidents. The institution has also been called upon to invest in communities at risk, building for all Americans basic economic rights that include jobs, housing, healthcare, and education.\n\nIn other areas, Congress has been urged to take action on gun reform, with some arguing that the institution needs to \"\"get real\"\" about guns and implement reforms to prevent gun violence. Additionally, Congress played a significant role in bankrupting the early American Republic and delaying the ratification of the Constitution due to issues surrounding the importation of Black people.\n\nOverall, Congress has been involved in a range of activities aimed at addressing various social and economic issues, from immigration and healthcare to racial equity and gun reform.\",16\r\n5675,\"\"\"COMMUNITIES AT RISK\"\"\",,1\r\n4444,\"\"\"PATSY MINK\"\"\",,1\r\n6839,\"\"\"HACKETT, ASHLEY\"\"\",,1\r\n9725,\"\"\"OMA SEDDIQ\"\"\",\"\"\"Oma Seddiq is a journalist reporting on Congress' hearing about anti-Asian violence in the wake of the Atlanta shootings.\"\"\",1\r\n9727,\"\"\"SONAM SHETH\"\"\",,1\r\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,rank\r\n337,\"\"\"STOP AAPI HATE\"\"\",\"\"\"CONGRESS\"\"\",\"Here is a comprehensive summary of the data:\n\n\"\"STOP AAPI HATE\"\" is likely to be involved in efforts to pass legislation addressing the issue of hate incidents, as seen in the proposed anti-hate crime bill.
