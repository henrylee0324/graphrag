The act suspended the immigration of Chinese laborers for 10 years, starting in 1882 and excluding women specifically in sexualized terms. This discriminatory act had long-lasting psychological effects on the Chinese American community.\n\nThe law was enacted as a response to xenophobia and racism towards Chinese immigrants, who were seen as racial, cultural, and biological threats. The Chinese Exclusion Act was an unjust government policy that led to mass resistance from Chinese Americans, perpetuating anti-Asian discrimination for decades.\n\nAs a historic event, the Chinese Exclusion Act excluded Chinese immigrants from entering the United States in the late 1800s, highlighting systemic racism against Asian Americans. It was also a notorious piece of legislation that excluded Chinese immigrants from the U.S., initially banning Chinese immigration and barring those already here from becoming citizens.\n\nThe act was seen as an example of discrimination against Asian Americans, perpetuating xenophobia and racism in the US. It was the only American law to exclude immigrants from a specific racial background, making it a significant event in the history of anti-Asian discrimination in the United States.\n\nOverall, the Chinese Exclusion Act was a federal law that had far-reaching consequences for the Chinese American community, perpetuating systemic racism and xenophobia for decades.\",11\r\n6416,\"\"\"1875 PAGE ACT\"\"\",,1\r\n1271,\"\"\"JAPANESE AMERICAN INTERNMENT\"\"\",\"\"\"The Japanese American Internment was a period during World War II when over 100,000 Japanese Americans were forcibly relocated and detained in internment camps, a form of state-sanctioned anti-Asian discrimination.\"\"\",1\r\n5303,\"\"\"U.S. CONGRESS\"\"\",\"\"\"The U.S. Congress passed the Chinese Exclusion Act in 1882, banning Chinese immigration for 60 years.\"\"\",1\r\n7479,\"\"\"HARVARD UNIVERSITY\"\"\",\"\"\"Harvard University documents a historical event in which 19 Chinese people were murdered by a mob in Los Angeles in 1871.\"\"\",1\r\n7853,\"\"\"CHINESE MASSACRE\"\"\",\"\"\"The Chinese Massacre in 1871 was a historical event where violence and discrimination were perpetrated against the Chinese community.\"\"\",1\r\n8988,\"\"\"ERIKA\"\"\",\"\"\"Erika shares her personal experience as someone whose grandfather arrived in this country during the Chinese Exclusion Act, highlighting the impact of anti-Asian racism and ultra assimilation on their family.\"\"\",1\r\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,rank\r\n1209,\"\"\"ASIAN AMERICANS\"\"\",\"\"\"CHINESE EXCLUSION ACT\"\"\",\"Here is a comprehensive summary of the data:\n\nAsian Americans, specifically those who are Chinese, have been victims of racism and discrimination throughout history, including during the era of the Chinese Exclusion Act.
