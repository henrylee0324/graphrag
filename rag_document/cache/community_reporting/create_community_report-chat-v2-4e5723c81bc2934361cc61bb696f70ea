It also involves structures, policies, practices, and norms that result in differential access to goods, services, and opportunities by race.\n\nThis form of racism is embedded in societal structures and institutions, perpetuating systemic inequalities and biases. It is condemned by organizations such as AAAJ-Atlanta, which has issued a statement with 180 signatories from state and national organizations denouncing both systemic racism and gender-based violence.\n\nFurthermore, systemic racism is recognized as a factor contributing to the rise of hate crimes against Asian Americans.
