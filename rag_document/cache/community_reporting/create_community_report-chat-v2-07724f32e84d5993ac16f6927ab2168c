According to Jeung, many Asian Americans are culturally reticent to deal with the government, distrustful of authority, or fearful of being discovered as undocumented immigrants, which can lead to underreporting of incidents. This cultural reticence may also contribute to a lack of reporting of hate crimes against Asian Americans, as they may not want to engage with law enforcement.\n\nJeung notes that racial profiling has been an issue during the COVID-19 pandemic, and that Trump's rhetoric has made Asian Americans more vulnerable to racist attacks. The virus itself has also incited racism and hatred towards Asian Americans, further exacerbating the problem.\n\nOverall, Jeung suggests that Asian Americans are facing a complex web of challenges related to harassment, violence, and underreporting of hate crimes, which can be attributed to a combination of cultural factors, systemic issues, and societal biases.\",321\r\n1220,\"\"\"ASIAN AMERICANS\"\"\",\"\"\"GOVERNMENT\"\"\",\"Here is a comprehensive summary of the data:\n\nAsian Americans are a group that requires protection from the Government.
