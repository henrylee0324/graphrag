In addition to its role in responding to the COVID-19 pandemic, Governments are responsible for respecting human rights, such as non-discrimination and transparency. Furthermore, Governments should attempt to recover missed in-person class time once schools reopen and adopt measures to mitigate the disproportionate effects on children who already experience barriers to education.\n\nThe Government is also responsible for protecting certain groups, including Asian Americans, with action and the full force of the law. However, some Governments have been criticized for perpetuating racial differences through their policies and pronouncements, as seen in the case of the Government of Singapore. In other cases, the government has failed to provide adequate testing, medical equipment, and scientific guidance during the pandemic, leading to chaos and fear among citizens.\n\nThe government's handling of the coronavirus crisis has been criticized by some, with Trump being a key figure in this criticism. Additionally, the government is sometimes portrayed as having a racist agenda, highlighting its negative impact on certain groups.
