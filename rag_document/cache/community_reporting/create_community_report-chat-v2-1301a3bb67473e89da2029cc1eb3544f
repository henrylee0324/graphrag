It is a conscious belief that one group is inherently superior to another due to skin color, leading to discriminatory actions. Racism is also a coordinated interaction of individual-level biases such as stereotypes, prejudice, and discrimination with societal- and cultural-level biases.\n\nRacism is a factor contributing to the increase in violence against Asians, perpetuating discrimination and unfair treatment. It is a form of systemic oppression that has resulted in poor outcomes for historically marginalized populations. Racism can lead to poor health and lack of access to resources, contributing to health inequities.\n\nRacism refers to discrimination based on race or ethnicity, which is a concern for individuals such as Celine Tien who want to protect their loved ones from experiencing it. It also refers to the act or assumption that makes minority communities feel different and not belonging. Racism can be experienced by anyone, regardless of their race or ethnicity, including Asians and Pacific Islanders.\n\nRacism is described as a key characteristic of institutional and systemic issues, emphasizing its impact on society. It is a socially defined circumstance that can lead to poor health and lack of access to resources, contributing to health inequities.
