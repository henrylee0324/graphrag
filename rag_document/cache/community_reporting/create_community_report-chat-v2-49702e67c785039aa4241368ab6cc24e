Additionally, there have been reports of harassment and discrimination against Asian Americans, with 35 hate crimes with Asian victims reported so far this year, compared to 11 such attacks by the same time last year.\n\nThe NYPD has implemented measures to combat hate crimes against Asian-Americans, including efforts to prosecute these crimes. Despite these efforts, some individuals may still feel unsafe or unsure about their place in NYC, as evidenced by one author's feelings of being \"\"unsure\"\" and \"\"un-American\"\" despite living there for three years.\n\nNYC is also the location where Richard Carranza, the Schools Chancellor, will leave his post, and where certain crimes have spiked, including auto thefts. The city has seen a significant increase in homicides, with 468 cases reported in 2020, up nearly 47% from 2019.\n\nIt's worth noting that NYC is not the only location where violent public attacks against Asian Americans have taken place; similar incidents have occurred in other cities such as Oakland and San Francisco.\",25\r\n1978,\"\"\"ALL-ASIAN UNDERCOVER POLICE TEAM\"\"\",,1\r\n8464,\"\"\"AMY HARMON\"\"\",\"\"\"Amy Harmon is a journalist reporting on the situation in New York City.\"\"\",1\r\n4322,\"\"\"ASIAN DESCENT PEOPLE\"\"\",,1\r\n6549,\"\"\"MR.
