Additionally, California has a geographic location mentioned in the text, where an Asian woman experiences a microaggression while running on a trail.\n\nCalifornia is also home to the Dolan Law Firm, which provides legal services to clients. The state has set up additional patrols in Chinatown due to growing assaults on Asians, highlighting its role in addressing this issue. California is considered one of the most Asian-friendly states where the author lives and is the location where FNA is based.\n\nThe state has reported more incidents of racism than any other state, with 1,691 reported incidents of anti-Asian crimes and incidents. Mr. Lee is alone in California during the pandemic, far from his family. Stop AAPI Hate, a nonprofit organization based in California, recorded incidents of anti-Asian discrimination across the United States.\n\nThe incident in California involves a 16-year-old Asian-American boy who was attacked by classmates for allegedly carrying the virus.
