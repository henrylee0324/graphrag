In the 1850s, they arrived as laborers and were perceived as threats to white jobs, leading to racist violence and scapegoating. However, their skills and willingness to take on backbreaking and dangerous work, such as railroad construction in the mid-1860s, earned them a degree of tolerance from some segments of society.\n\nDespite these challenges, Chinese immigrants have also experienced moments of connection and understanding with the broader community. For example, Cao's comics have been seen as a positive representation of their experiences, indicating a sense of belonging and recognition within the community.\n\nUnfortunately, many Chinese immigrants were forced to live in segregated Chinatowns in cities like San Francisco, where they faced redlining by financial institutions and often had to fend for themselves without access to mainstream resources. Nevertheless, their resilience and determination have allowed them to thrive in the face of adversity.\n\nOverall, the history of CHINESE IMMIGRANTS is complex and multifaceted, reflecting both the challenges and opportunities that they have faced as they sought to build new lives in America.\",6\r\n2827,\"\"\"ANTI-CHINESE RACE RIOTS\"\"\",,1\r\n7858,\"\"\"1882 CHINESE EXCLUSION ACT\"\"\",\"Here is a comprehensive summary of the data:\n\nThe \"\"1882 Chinese Exclusion Act\"\" was a law that restricted the immigration of Chinese people to the United States.\n\nThis summary includes all the information provided in the description list, and it is written in third person.
