Some immigrants may require special care, such as medical attention, due to their health status or other circumstances. Others may prioritize assimilation as a lifelong goal, seeking to blend in with their new surroundings.\n\nThe experiences of immigrants are diverse, ranging from those who have been allowed to enter the country and start anew to those who have been affected by changing immigration policies and quotas.
