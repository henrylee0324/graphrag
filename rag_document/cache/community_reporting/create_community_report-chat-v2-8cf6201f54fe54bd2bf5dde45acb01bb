The CDC advises against using stigmatizing rhetoric, linking diseases to specific locations or ethnicities, as this can lead to negative consequences. Instead, they recommend communicating the facts that viruses do not target specific racial or ethnic groups.\n\nThe CDC provides daily updates and recommendations during pandemics, including demographic data on COVID-19 cases, such as race and ethnicity information. They also provide guidance on reducing and avoiding stigma and discrimination, highlighting their role in promoting public health and safety.\n\nIn addition to providing data and guidance, the CDC has taken steps to combat misinformation. For example, they provided COVID-19 case and death counts that were deemed \"\"fake news\"\" by Trump. The CDC had not announced any cases of the novel coronavirus in the United States at the time, but they did provide information on how fear and anxiety can lead to social stigma towards Asian Americans.\n\nThe CDC also provides demographic detail on cases of COVID-19, including race and ethnicity information, as well as data on Covid-19 vaccine recipients by race/ethnicity. They offer guidance on safe distancing in schools, including reducing the distance between students from six feet to three feet.\n\nOverall, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is a health organization that warns against the negative consequences of linking diseases to specific locations or ethnicities and provides critical information and guidance to promote public health and safety during pandemics.\",15\r\n4019,\"\"\"US CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION\"\"\",\"Here is a comprehensive summary of the data:\n\nThe US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (US CDC) advises against using language that exacerbates prejudice and discrimination in ways that put lives at risk of violence.
