He was attacked by two white autoworkers, Michael Notten and Ronald Ebens, who mistakenly believed him to be Japanese due to his Asian features. The attack was motivated by racial hatred and a desire to scapegoat Asians for the decline of the US auto industry.\n\nThe murder sparked widespread outrage and protests against anti-Asian racism, leading to the creation of organizations such as American Citizens for Justice (ACJ) and Asian Americans Advancing Justice (AAAJ). Chin's death also highlighted the long history of anti-Asian bias in the United States, which continues to this day.\n\nChin's murder was a hate crime, and his attackers were acquitted by a jury. However, the case led to increased awareness and activism against anti-Asian racism, with many considering it a turning point in the fight for Asian American civil rights.\n\nIn summary, Vincent Chin was a Chinese American man who was brutally murdered in 1982 due to racial hatred and mistaken identity.
