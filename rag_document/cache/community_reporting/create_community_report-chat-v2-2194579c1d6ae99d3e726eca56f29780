This has led to a rise in hate crimes, including attacks on individuals, such as Noel Quintana, Ee Lee, and Vicha Ratanapakdee.\n\nThe community has been targeted by random attacks, harassment, bullying, and violence across the city, with some incidents reported in New York City. Asian-Americans have also been victims of verbal and physical attacks in areas like Oakland's Chinatown.\n\nDiscrimination against Asian-Americans is not new; they have historically been treated as \"\"The Other,\"\" the perpetual foreigner, regardless of their generation in the US. The pandemic has exacerbated these issues, with some individuals feeling increasingly vulnerable to violence and hate crimes.\n\nAsian-Americans are a diverse group tracing their roots to more than 20 countries in East Asia, Southeast Asia, and the Indian subcontinent. However, they have been excluded from conversations in Hollywood and media, feeling invisible and erased.\n\nThe community has reported increased incidents of bigotry and discrimination due to the pandemic, with some individuals experiencing language barriers, worries over immigration status, fear of retaliation, or not wanting to make trouble when reporting crimes.\n\nAsian-Americans are encouraged to express their pain and feelings, indicating their importance in the context. They are also being targeted by racist memes and posts online, leading to real-world violence.\n\nThe community has been affected by attacks since the start of the pandemic, with 2,808 reported incidents between March 19, 2020, and December 2020.
