This demographic group has been affected by health disparities, societal barriers, and structural racism, resulting in systemic inequalities in areas such as the justice system, education, housing, employment, and access to care.\n\nBlack people are disproportionately represented in the prison population and face anxiety and fear on a regular basis due to systemic racism and discrimination. They also experience health disparities, including high rates of diabetes, which highlights a disparity in health outcomes.\n\nHistorically, Black people were subjected to inferior treatment, such as being forced to sit in the peanut gallery during performances. Today, they continue to face challenges, including voter suppression, with the overwhelming majority of victims being Black people.\n\nIn addition to these systemic issues, Black people are underrepresented in certain fields, such as cardiology, and have been affected by health disparities that result from structural racism. They also do not identify with the term \"\"people of color\"\" due to historical treatment that does not apply to other racial demographics.\n\nReal Estate Agents often target their home showings at Black neighborhoods, highlighting the need for greater diversity in the real estate industry.
