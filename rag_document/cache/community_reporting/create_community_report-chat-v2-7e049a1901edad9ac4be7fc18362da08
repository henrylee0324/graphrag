Additionally, the government has been blamed by some for the spread of the virus itself. However, it is also acknowledged that the Chinese Government made mistakes at the beginning of the outbreak but has since taken steps to cooperate and provide vital medical equipment and supplies.\n\nThe government has also faced criticism for its response to certain terms used to describe the coronavirus, urging against their use. Furthermore, some have accused the government of not allowing nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) to operate freely, with reduced funding during the outbreak affecting some groups.\n\nIn addition, the Chinese Government has issued travel advisories and alerts for Chinese students studying in Australia due to rising discrimination and violent attacks.
