On one hand, it has made economic inroads into the Chinese market by selling wines to China.

This has led to a crisis affecting the country, with Prime Minister Scott Morrison speaking about defending its national sovereignty.\n\nDomestically, Australia is a multicultural nation where people from different backgrounds live and work together. However, this diversity has also been marred by instances of unacceptable race discrimination and xenophobia against Chinese people during the COVID-19 pandemic.
