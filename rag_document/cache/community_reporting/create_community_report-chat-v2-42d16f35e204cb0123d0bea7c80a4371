This is evident in the Atlanta mass shootings, where Asian American women were among the victims, highlighting issues of gender and race.\n\nThe phrase \"\"me love you long time\"\" and its connotations of sexual objectification are a common experience for many Asian American women, perpetuating harmful stereotypes and reinforcing their vulnerability to discrimination.

They understand that Robert Long's actions were a result of a culture filled with racialized and sexualized views of them.\n\nNAPAWF supports Asian American women in particular, highlighting their specific experiences with racism and xenophobia.
