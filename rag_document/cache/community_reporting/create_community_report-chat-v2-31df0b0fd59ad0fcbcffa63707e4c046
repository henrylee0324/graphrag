It perpetuates racism and dehumanization, driving anti-Asian sentiment during the pandemic. This concept also fuels violence against Asian Americans, highlighting systemic racism. White supremacy is a systemic issue that is literally killing Asian American communities, according to Stephanie Cho. It is a root of racism that drives the dehumanization of Asian people in U.S. society. Additionally, it refers to a system of oppression and discrimination against people of color, which has gained fresh momentum in recent years from the intensified polarization of American politics. Furthermore, White supremacy is the dominant ideology that perpetuates racism and oppression in American culture, consistently betraying the 'model minority' myth and driving a wedge between Asian Americans and their natural allies.\n\nNote: I have concatenated all the descriptions into a single summary, resolving any contradictions to provide a coherent and comprehensive overview of the concept of \"\"WHITE SUPREMACY\"\".\",15\r\n2606,\"\"\"GROUNDHOG DAY\"\"\",,2\r\n6217,\"\"\"MATSUYAMA\"\"\",\"Here is a comprehensive summary of the data:\n\nMatsuyama is a person who is aware of the racism and violence faced by Asian Americans.
