They have reported 2.3 times more \"\"hate incidents\"\" than men during the pandemic, according to Stop AAPI Hate. This generation of Asian American women is subject to hearing the phrase 'me love you long time' and its connotations of sexual objectification, which perpetuates harmful stereotypes.\n\nAsian American women are disproportionately affected by hate crimes and discrimination, as seen in the Atlanta mass shootings and other incidents. They are also targeted by shooters, as seen in the killings at massage parlors, with implications for their gender and racial identities. In fact, two Asian American women were among the victims of a series of murders in Atlanta, highlighting issues of gender and race.\n\nAsian American women share stories about the sacrifices of their immigrant parents and grandparents, and the resilience required to assimilate in a country where Asians face ongoing harassment and xenophobia. They understand that Robert Long's actions were a result of a culture filled with racialized and sexualized views of them.\n\nThe nail industry is predominantly made up of Asian American women, making them vulnerable targets. NAPAWF supports Asian American women in particular, highlighting their specific experiences with racism and xenophobia. Two Asian American women were verbally harassed by a man shouting racial slurs while walking near St. Petersburg's downtown waterfront, further emphasizing the need for support and understanding.\n\nOverall, Asian American women face a range of challenges, including racism, misogyny, immigration status issues, and discrimination, which can make it difficult to separate the Georgia shooter's apparent misogyny from the specter of racism.\",16\r\n1606,\"\"\"CHICAGO TRIBUNE\"\"\",\"Here is a comprehensive summary of the data:\n\nThe Chicago Tribune is a news organization that has been involved in reporting on various topics related to Asian-hate crimes and protests.
