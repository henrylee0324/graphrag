This language has contributed to the rise in racial harassment and discrimination against Asian Americans. Some experts believe that his repeated use of these terms has stoked xenophobia and anti-Asian bias. Additionally, President Trump's casual use of terms like \"\"kung flu\"\" and \"\"China virus\"\" has been seen as contributing to the spread of hate and discrimination against Asian Americans.\n\nIt is worth noting that some critics have accused President Trump of using language that is intentionally divisive and harmful, including referring to undocumented immigrants as \"\"infesting\"\" the US. Furthermore, his leadership during the pandemic has been criticized for being overly focused on retaliatory actions against patriotic Americans, rather than taking a more nuanced approach to addressing the crisis.\n\nOverall, President Trump's rhetoric regarding the virus and China has been seen by some as contributing to the rise in racial harassment, according to academic experts on race. His repeated use of terms like \"\"Kung Flu\"\" has contributed to further stoking anti-Asian American harassment, and his language has been blamed for inspiring racism against Asian Americans.\n\nI hope this summary is helpful!
