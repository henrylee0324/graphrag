However, they also found solace in Cao's comics, indicating a positive connection with the community. Despite this, many Chinese immigrants were forced into Chinatowns in cities like San Francisco, where they faced financial exclusion and struggled to make ends meet.\n\nThe immigrant experience was marked by both tolerance and ridicule. On one hand, their willingness to take on backbreaking and dangerous railroad work that white workers refused to do earned them a degree of acceptance in the mid-1860s. On the other hand, their pidgin English was often mocked, leading to the phrase \"\"no can do\"\" being used to belittle their language skills.\n\nOverall, the experiences of Chinese immigrants in the United States during this period were marked by both struggle and resilience, as they navigated a complex web of racism, economic exclusion, and cultural misunderstandings.\",7\r\n3052,\"\"\"ANTI-CHINESE RACE RIOTS\"\"\",,1\r\n7656,\"\"\"NO CAN DO\"\"\",,1\r\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,rank\r\n2324,\"\"\"PANDEMIC\"\"\",\"\"\"WHITE AMERICANS\"\"\",\"\"\"White Americans are less affected by the Pandemic and its increased violence against Asians.\"\"\",144\r\n1714,\"\"\"ASIANS\"\"\",\"\"\"WHITE AMERICANS\"\"\",\"\"\"Asians have been subjected to derogatory language and violence by White Americans.\"\"\",38\r\n4301,\"\"\"U.S.\"\"\",\"\"\"CHINESE IMMIGRANTS\"\"\",\"\"\"Chinese immigrants were subject to racist violence and scapegoating by the U.S. government and society.\"\"\",26\r\n3447,\"\"\"BLACKS\"\"\",\"\"\"WHITE AMERICANS\"\"\",\"\"\"White Americans denied civil rights to Asian Americans and oppressed them in America, Africa, and Latin America.\"\"\",15\r\n5331,\"\"\"CHINATOWNS\"\"\",\"\"\"CHINESE IMMIGRANTS\"\"\",\"\"\"Chinese immigrants were shunted into Chinatowns in San Francisco and other cities, redlined by financial institutions, and often left to fend for themselves.\"\"\",13\r\n5907,\"\"\"CHINESE IMMIGRANTS\"\"\",\"\"\"CAO\"\"\",\"\"\"Cao's illustrations have helped Chinese immigrants feel seen and understood, fostering a connection with the community.\"\"\",12\r\n5905,\"\"\"CHINESE IMMIGRANTS\"\"\",\"\"\"WHITE AMERICANS\"\"\",\"\"\"White Americans were responsible for perpetuating violence and racism against Chinese immigrants.\"\"\",11\r\n5909,\"\"\"CHINESE IMMIGRANTS\"\"\",\"\"\"SENATORS\"\"\",\"\"\"The Senators' actions led to the passage of the 1882 Chinese Exclusion Act, which had negative consequences for Chinese immigrants, demonstrating their direct involvement in shaping their lives.\"\"\",10\r\n5906,\"\"\"CHINESE IMMIGRANTS\"\"\",\"\"\"ANTI-CHINESE RACE RIOTS\"\"\",\"\"\"The Anti-Chinese race riots targeted Chinese immigrants and their communities.\"\"\",8\r\n5908,\"\"\"CHINESE IMMIGRANTS\"\"\",\"\"\"NO CAN DO\"\"\",\"\"\"The phrase 'no can do' originated from the mockery of Chinese immigrants' pidgin English, highlighting their cultural differences.\"\"\",8\r\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
