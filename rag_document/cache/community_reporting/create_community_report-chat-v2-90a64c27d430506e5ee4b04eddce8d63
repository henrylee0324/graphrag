According to various descriptions, LONG confessed to committing the shootings, citing his sex addiction as a motivation instead of racial bias. He has been charged with eight counts of murder and one count of aggravated assault.\n\nLONG's motivations for the attacks are disputed, with some descriptions suggesting that they may have been motivated by anti-Asian bias, while others claim that he was driven by sexual addiction or a desire to remove sexual temptation. LONG's family identified him after images of him were circulated, enabling officials to track his mobile phone and capture him without incident.\n\nThe victims of LONG's attacks include those affected by the fetishization of Asian women, highlighting the persistence of stereotypes and misperceptions. The shootings have been described as \"\"horrific acts of violence\"\" that targeted Asian Americans.\n\nLONG was taken into custody and transported to the Crisp County jail after his vehicle spun out of control. He has been charged with four counts of murder and one count of assault, and is suspected of planning to carry out attacks in Florida before being apprehended.\n\nIt's worth noting that some descriptions suggest that LONG may have had a history of sexual addiction or fetishization of Asian women, which could have contributed to his motivations for the attacks.
