This rhetoric has been criticized for perpetuating racism against Asian Americans.\n\n**Impact of Trump's Rhetoric**\n\nTrump's use of these terms led to hundreds of incidents of harassment using similar language, causing harm to the Asian American community. The rhetoric also contributed to a surge in hate crimes against Asian Americans, with many feeling scapegoated and blamed for the pandemic.\n\n**Warnings and Concerns**\n\nHealth organizations warned that Trump's rhetoric would incite racist threats against Asian Americans, but he continued to use these terms despite the warnings. Many experts believe that Trump's language contributed to a rise in attacks on Asian American elders and a negative narrative about Asian-Americans.\n\n**Trump's Statements**\n\nSome notable statements made by Trump include:\n\n* \"\"It is very important that we totally protect our Asian-American community in the United States, and all around the world.\"\"\n* \"\"We must protect our Asian-American community from blame and scapegoating.\"\"\n* \"\"The spread of COVID-19 is not the fault of Asian Americans.\"\"\n\n**Consequences**\n\nTrump's rhetoric has been linked to a rise in hate crimes, bias among police officers, and a negative narrative about Asian-Americans.
