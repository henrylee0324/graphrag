Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: One of the following types: [organization,person,geo,event]\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\n Format each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3.

On April 3, Fight COVID Racism reported 980 incidents of anti-Asian hate crimes across Canada during the pandemic. \nAccording to 2016 Statistics Canada, approximately 1,400 people of Asian descent live in Peterborough, and during this COVID pandemic, they have been feeling the effects of anti-Asian racism. Their racist incidents have been more subtle, a microaggression, \"feeling of being watched\" or \"getting a look,\" the feeling of \"what are you doing here,\" or \"you don't belong here.\" \nDuring this COVID-19 era, members of an Asian family who have lived in Peterborough for a few years were celebrating their child's birthday party. For the first time since living in Peterborough, a stranger yelled, \"Go back to China.\" \nNot all Asians are from China, and they are not a monolithic ethnic group. \nThe diversity among Asians is vast and varied like any other ethnic group. The ignorance of people, allied with the philosophy of Trumpism, has given rise to the anti-Asian racism. Their narrative may also include references to the Chinese Communist political system and Chinese oligarchy. These detrimental opinions are red herrings and should have no place within the context of anti-Asian racism. \nInstead, we need to stop this cycle of hate toward those\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "llama3", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": null}}
