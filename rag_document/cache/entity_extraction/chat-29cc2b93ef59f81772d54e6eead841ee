Her mother is White. Her father, who is Japanese, came to the United States in 1961 for college, where he met his wife. \nShe spent gap year in Tokyo, where her father is from, in the 1980s. People would ask her: \"Isn't America so dangerous? Don't people pull out guns all the time?\" \nDecades later, there have been so many mass shootings and so many people whose lives have been permanently altered by gun violence. But for Hatta, the Atlanta shooting impacted her on multiple levels. \nThere was a familiar banality of the circumstances: The victims were simply people who showed up for work that day, like herself in 2008. They were immigrants, like Hatta's father - who came to America for new opportunities. \nWhen Hatta found out six of the victims were of Asian descent, she thought about the fact that the thousands of verbal, physical and online attacks reported to the Stop AAPI Hate hotline since the outbreak of the pandemic have been disproportionately reported by women. \n\"You add a gun to the situation and Asian women are even more vulnerable.... Knowing people who chose to come here and made a life, and just to have something like this happen - I don't want to say it's worse than if it happened to someone else, but it adds so many layers as to why it hurts.\"\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "llama3", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": null}}
