The Biden administration given his 50-year record of persecuting Blacks (best seen with refusal to continue the criminal justice reform policies of Trump and maniacal belief that Blacks are at war against Asians and his worship of mass incarceration policies), his total slave-like obedience to the COVID-19 mandated fascism over American life, his nonsensical immigration policies and tolerance for human trafficking, and his deviant sexual obsession with offending the religious and moral sentiments of scores of millions of Americans promoting transgenderism and genital mutilation of minors preclude his being able to unite America in anything but bloodshed and chaos. \nQ: Given the U.S. performance under the Trump presidency, do you think the country can present a successful model of governance to the world? \nI have no faith in the present administration of President Joseph R.
