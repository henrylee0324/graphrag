Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: One of the following types: [organization,person,geo,event]\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\n Format each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3.

Social media has lit up. \nTheir common theme: The incident is mobilizing Asian-Americans who have seen their communities victimized by hate crimes over the past year, even if police haven't determined whether the shooting belongs in that category. At vigils, on Twitter and in workplaces, the slayings seemed to resonate with millions of people in a way that many said was reminiscent of George Floyd, a Black man whose death in Minneapolis police custody sparked a summer of unrest and conversations about race in the U.S. \nPresident Biden ordered flags at federal buildings to be flown at half-staff in honor of the victims and plans to meet with Asian-American leaders in Atlanta on Friday. Many employers were quick to declare their support for racial equity and for Asian-Americans in particular. \nInvestigators with the sheriff's office of Cherokee County, site of the spa where the first four people were fatally shot, said Wednesday they had yet to find evidence that the violence was racially motivated.
