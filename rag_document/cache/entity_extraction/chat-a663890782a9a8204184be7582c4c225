Several candidates are going all-in.\nOne poisonous election ad for Florida Congressional candidate Casey Askar states: \"China unleashed the Wuhan pandemic on the world, costing trillions, costing jobs, costing American lives.\"\nAnother, for Texas candidate Kathaleen Walsh, depicts the \"Chinese virus\" sailing toward the U.S. \"China is a criminal enterprise masquerading as a sovereign nation,\" the ad alleges. \"It's time to fight back.\"\nIt's important to ask what this strategy achieves, and at what cost. Racist messaging has proved an effective way to fire up Trump's base.
