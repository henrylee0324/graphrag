Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: One of the following types: [organization,person,geo,event]\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\n Format each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3.

This was my normal. I truly never understood that I as a person my culture, my language, and my community - deserved to be respected. \nA significant reason why I lacked the language was I didn't know the history of my people. Only when I began to read more about Black Americans' history and struggle for equal rights did the lightbulb turn on. I realized that what happened and is still happening to communities of color is not right. Only then did I gradually begin to connect my own experiences to America's long history of colonialism and occupation in Asia, unconstitutional legal sanctions, internments, mob lynchings, and genocide of Asian communities and other communities of color. \n\u2015 \nBased on many U.S. textbooks, history seems to have forgotten. For that reason, anti-Asian crimes, like those against my parents and like the recent Atlanta mass shootings - are often incorrectly treated as isolated robberies, random assaults, or civil disputes rather than hate crimes. \n\u2015 \nThe culture of conformity and immigrant vulnerability perpetuated my parents' silence. It drove the shame of being targeted, the desire to avoid confrontation, the traumatic detachment, as well as a healthy mistrust of law enforcement, who could be as dismissive and hostile as our attackers. \nMy parents also believed that if we assimilated with those around us, we could achieve success.
