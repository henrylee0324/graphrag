Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: One of the following types: [organization,person,geo,event]\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\n Format each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3.

I wrote poems and played basketball. I lived the \"normal\" North American life. \nThe other part of what I was saying, however, stemmed from a more cowardly impulse. By saying \"I'm not Chinese,\" I was also saying, \"I'm not part of the ethnic group I believe you're targeting with your racism.\" As if by differentiating myself from the targeted group, I could somehow sidestep the racism. I felt the aspirational whiteness that Margaret Cho speaks about, and I wanted the racist bullies to accept me for who I was. I was willing to throw Chinese-Americans under the bus to make that happen. I felt ashamed and defenceless against the boy's racism, as do most people when they are attacked. \nBut the bystander in this equation had power - a kind of power that is often not flexed, or even realized. What if that boy's friend had stepped in and said, \"That's not right, that's not right at all!\" What if that friend had called the boy out on his racist comment? Could that have helped change the boy's behaviour, if not his attitude? It's been decades since I've been called ch--, but as I see the rise of anti-Asian hate around me, I realize that when we don't speak up, we are not simply being non- confrontational bystanders, we are complicit with this behaviour in the world. We cannot be innocent bystanders\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "llama3", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": null}}
