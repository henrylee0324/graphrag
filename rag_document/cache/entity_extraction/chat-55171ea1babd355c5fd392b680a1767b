Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: One of the following types: [organization,person,geo,event]\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\n Format each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3.

It's burned into my brain.\" \nMs. Cho creates food to help bridge cultural gaps and to help people heal. The Los Angeles native of Korean descent has lived in Pittsburgh for much of the past 19 years. In 2016, the Squirrel Hill resident created Yummyholic, an online bakery that she uses to elevate awareness on social justice issues. She calls it \"cookie activism.\" \n\"I use cookies as a medium because it is intentionally disarming and it keeps people's hearts tender,\" she said. \nShe's authored a children's book, and her work has been featured on \"CBS This Morning,\" NPR and the Food Network. In 2018, she hosted a TED talk in Pittsburgh about using baking to tell stories of Asian American history. Still based in Pittsburgh, Ms. Cho is now a master's candidate at New York's prestigious Pratt Institute, where she is developing a program that uses baking as therapy for those who have suffered trauma. \nSome of the first cookies she did during the pandemic depicted the exhausted faces of nurses in Wuhan. They are red, raw, swollen and creased from wearing masks and working nonstop. \n\"I was really moved, and I felt that necessity to put those faces out there with a message trying to remind folks that the same people you're demon\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "llama3", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": null}}
