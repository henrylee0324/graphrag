Dang spoke with Hong Lee, the 35-year-old victim of a racist verbal attack at a Los Angeles restaurant, who had been taking the boxing classes. \nThe three began discussions that expanded to include a network of friends and acquaintances, including mixed martial arts fighter Ron Scolesdang. \nTheir first class, in Hawthorne on May 12, drew about 20 seniors. A few weeks later, in Little Saigon, more than 200 showed up. \nThe group of about 10 volunteers is seeking nonprofit status and is hoping to expand to more cities in Southern California and across the country. \nIn California, anti-Asian hate crimes more than doubled last year, according to the state attorney general. \nThen-President Trump has emphasized the coronavirus' Chinese origins, and some people have attacked Asian Americans with rhetoric asserting that they are to blame for the pandemic. \nElderly Asian immigrants who are assaulted are often reluctant to speak out, said Linda Vo, a professor of Asian American studies at UC Irvine. \nMany are wary of the police, uncomfortable about communicating in English or ashamed about being victims, she said. But the rise in anti-Asian attacks has mobilized many Asian Americans and encouraged them to share their experiences, according to Judy Wu, a professor of Asian American studies at UC Irvine. \n\"It\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "llama3", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": null}}
