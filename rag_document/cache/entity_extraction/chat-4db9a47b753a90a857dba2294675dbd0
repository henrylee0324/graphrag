Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: One of the following types: [organization,person,geo,event]\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\n Format each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3.

Yang, president and executive director of Asian Americans Advancing Justice in\nWashington.\nThat mutual suspicion has boiled over several times in recent history. In 1991, a Korean American\nconvenience store owner in Los Angeles accused 15-year-old Latasha Harlins of shoplifting before fatally\nshooting her. The shopkeeper was convicted of voluntary manslaughter but served no jail time. A year\nlater, the acquittal of the Los Angeles police officers who beat Rodney King set off riots in the city, during\nwhich many Korean shops were burned and looted.\n\u201cThere was a sense that the shopkeepers were not respectful of the Black clientele, didn\u2019t trust the Black\nclientele, and also overcharged the Black clientele,\u201d said Brenda Stevenson, a history professor at UCLA\nand author of \u201cThe Contested Murder of Latasha Harlins: Justice, Gender and the Origins of the L.A. Riots.\u201d\n\u201cOn the other side, the Korean American shopkeepers at the time felt that the clientele were dangerous\nand untrustworthy. Some of them had been assaulted, some had been killed.\u201d\nAs the coronavirus pandemic has saddled low-income communities with economic hardships, community\ncallouts and social media posts seeking volunteers to help protect business owners and older residents\nhave proliferated in Asian American neighborhoods. The volunteer patrols pass out whistles so residents\ncan alert others to active crimes, and offer to walk with older neighbors as they run errands\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "llama3", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": null}}
