It lurched when my college roommate told me how a random white woman hurled racist insults at her and her daughter while they were shopping one day. As the wave of anti-Asian crime swelled in early 2021, I became increasingly concerned. These people around the country being assaulted and attacked with increasing levels of violence looked like me, like my family. Yet there was barely any attention from the media and authorities did too little to condemn these acts. My fears intensified when eight people were killed in metro Atlanta, including six women of Asian descent. \nI think and write extensively about the distinction between feeling safe and being safe. The feeling of safety, and the emotional peace it brings, is sometimes illusory. I often discuss how to identify when danger is lurking in the wings and how to prepare for its reality. So it's been disquieting to find myself caught in a trap like one I've often wamed others about: my feeling of being safely American enough blinded me from my precarious position as someone who at any moment could be deemed an enemy outsider, free to be attacked. I once would have thought that paranoia, yet here we are. \nOne tenet of my personal protection philosophy is that in that moment of gravest extreme, you must assume you are on your own. No one is coming to save you. That assumption is so core to my beliefs that it is embodied in the name I work under: On Her Own\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "llama3", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": null}}
