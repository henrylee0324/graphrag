Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: One of the following types: [organization,person,geo,event]\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\n Format each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3.

I grew up in Vancouver and now work in Toronto, and none of the people I work with, nor the people I meet in Zoom meetings, are racist. I don't encounter racism at the grocery store or on the streets where I live. Those acts of violence I had read about didn't seem to reflect my reality, or that of most Canadians. \nBut in fact, it's happening all around us. My partner was standing in line outside a bank in Toronto's Chinatown when someone started shouting at the Asian people in the queue, calling them \"ch--\" and telling them they didn't belong here. An Asian woman walking in Downtown Vancouver was confronted on the sidewalk and assaulted. \nVerbal harassment, spitting, outright acts of violence, the list of incidents in these and other cities across the globe goes on. Anti-Asian violence has been on the rise since the moment former U.S. President Donald Trump blamed China for the COVID-19 virus, calling it the \"Chinese virus.\" He not only legitimized racism against Asians, he fanned the flames. \nAs lockdowns were announced and the economy slowed down, feelings of anger, disempowerment and fear have intensified among the millions who have lost their jobs or homes, and along with them, their sense of security.
