Trump continued to use this phrase despite criticism from Democratic legislators as well as Asian American advocates and Public health experts, who said that the use of the phrase inflamed tensions and cited a surge in attacks on Asian Americans. Scott Kennedy, an expert at the center for strategic and international studies, said that Trump's use of the phrase fueled a narrative relating not only to the Chinese Communist Party \"but of China and Chinese people in general\" and was \"xenophobic and tinged with racist overtones,\" especially given the Trump administration's past statements and actions.\nTo conclude, hope that the world will soon surmount the ongoing pandemic but the pandemic of xenophobia launched particularly against Chinese people and generally against the people of East Asian and South Asian descent, if not inhibited earnestly, would continue to haunt the generations to come and thereby jeopardize the peace of the world.\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "llama3", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": null}}
