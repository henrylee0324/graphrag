Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: One of the following types: [organization,person,geo,event]\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\n Format each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3.

Wealth, whiteness,\ncitizenship, patriarchy, heterosexism, and education are a few key social mechanisms through which\npower operates. Although power is often conceptualized as power over other individuals or groups,\nother variations are power with (used in the context of building collective strength) and power within\n(which references an individual\u2019s internal strength). Learning to \u201csee\u201d and understand relations of power\nis vital to organizing for progressive social change. Power may also be understood as the ability to\ninfluence others and impose one\u2019s beliefs. All power is relational, and the different relationships either\nreinforce or disrupt one another. The importance of the concept of power to anti-racism is clear: racism\ncannot be understood without understanding that power is not only an individual relationship but a\ncultural one, and that power relationships are shifting constantly. Power can be used malignantly and\nintentionally, but need not be, and individuals within a culture may benefit from power of which they are\nunaware.
