Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: One of the following types: [organization,person,geo,event]\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\n Format each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3.

She also suggests people allocate some time during the day to process their worries, perhaps via expressive writing in journals.\n\"That way some of the tension is released during the day itself.\" At MindPeers, Agarwal's team of psychologists often ask their clients to draw their palm on a paper and write all the things they can control within the palm and those out of their control outside the palm. It gives them perspective and a direction to tackle their worries, she says. A lot of people are also finding solace in the fact that they're not alone in this, that many people are battling insomnia at present.\nMost therapists are also actively discouraging clients from using sleep trackers during this period if too much information about their sleep cycle overwhelms them. The makers of certain sleep trackers propagate this, too. \"If users express anxiety over tracking their sleep, we advise them to go scrap trackers and concentrate on how they feel in the morning.
