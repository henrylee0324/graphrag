His brother is 73, has Parkinson\u2019s disease and cancer, and no longer feels safe leaving his house.\nThe assault felt like a flashback to the mid-1980s when Chong helped organize community meetings in Oakland to help stem violence targeted at refugees from Asia who had come to the Bay Area. Chong said he is deeply concerned to hear the murders in Atlanta aren\u2019t being treated as hate crimes mired in America\u2019s long history of discrimination against Asian people.\n\u201cWe feel under siege right now.
