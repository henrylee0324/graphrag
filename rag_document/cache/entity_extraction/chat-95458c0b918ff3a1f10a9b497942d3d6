Sadly, modern anti-Semites are right now on the internet weaving similarly insane conspiracy theories blaming Jews for spreading coronavirus.\nIndeed, the Simon Wiesenthal Center just turned over a list of some 45 channels on social media platforms like Telegram and Gab to United States Attorney General William Barr and Homeland Security that promote lurid conspiracy theories linking Jews to the pandemic and urging those suffering from CoronaVirus to go to synagogues and mosques to spread the deadly virus.\nNone of us is immune from accidentally falling prey to misinformation that can hurt our neighbors. One of us Councilman Joshi posted a thoughtless tweet that potentially could have hurt my Jewish neighbors. As an Indo-American I should have known better. I apologized and toured the nearby Jewish community and learned first-hand of their commitment and struggle to help fight the pandemic.\nWorking together with all people of good faith we will hopefully soon be beneficiaries of a vaccine to stop the pandemic. But no one has yet come up with a cure for history's oldest virus hate.\nWe all must reject any and all efforts seeking to conflate justified anger at the Chinese communist government with anger towards Asian-Americans. This is the height of hypocrisy, and insulting to the many Chinese-Americans who fled to our country specifically to escape repression by the Chinese government. We should never blame immigrants from any country for the actions of a foreign government that they have no control over.\nWhat can we do to fight hate and protect our neighbors?
