Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: One of the following types: [organization,person,geo,event]\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\n Format each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3.

But for many Asian Americans, the massacre last month by a 21-year-old white man was the culmination of a year of anti-Asian hatred. \n\"This has been with us for at least a solid year and likely to be much longer,\" said Manjusha Kulkarni, executive director of the Asian Pacific Policy and Planning Council and a co-founder of Stop AAPI Hate. \nFrom March 2020 to February, nearly 3,800 attacks against Asian Americans nationwide were reported to Stop AAPI Hate. A report by the group that will be released within weeks shows a \"significant increase\" in anti-Asian attacks in the last year, Kulkarni said. \n\"Really, that's just the tip of the iceberg through February,\" she said. \nInitially, many of the attacks that gained widespread media attention were violent assaults against elderly Asian pedestrians for which authorities did not determine a motive because the attacker did not say anything racist. \nOther attacks have included racial slurs, sometimes accompanied by physical assaults. \nOn Tuesday, a man followed an Asian woman into her garage, shouted racial insults and spat in her face, El Cerrito Police Lt.
