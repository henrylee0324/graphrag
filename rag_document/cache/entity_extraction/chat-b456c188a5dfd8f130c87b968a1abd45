Although happening everywhere in the country, the trend is particularly pronounced in Fairfax County, where just over 30 percent of Asian families selected in-person learning for the spring. \nThat rate was by far the lowest reported among any racial group.\nAsked about the Fairfax school system's response to the incident at Longfellow, spokeswoman Lloyd pointed to a statement the district published in response to the Georgia massacre. The statement noted that \"misinformation and xenophobic language\" have led to targeting of Asian students and families within the county. \n\"It is our responsibility to ensure that all people are treated with dignity and humanity in our schools,\" the statement reads. \"These behaviors are more than being unkind and will not be tolerated.\"\nWhen asked whether reports of anti-Asian bullying have increased in Fairfax schools recently, Lloyd said, \"We haven't seen a noticeable rise.\" Guglielmi of the Fairfax County police\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "llama3", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": null}}
