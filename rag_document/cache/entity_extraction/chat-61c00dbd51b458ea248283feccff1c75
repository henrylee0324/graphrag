Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: One of the following types: [organization,person,geo,event]\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\n Format each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3.

But this is another chapter in Chinese history that will undoubtedly be filled with hardship and prejudice.\nSome Chinese people there say they have been treated like vermin because of the Covid-19 pandemic.\nIn Scotland, for example, police said 474 hate crimes against Chinese and Asian and Southeast Asian people were reported between January and December last year, compared to 316 the year before. This is an increase of about 50 per cent.\nThere are no set rules or strategies to combat or stop racism because of how it manifests itself. Racism isn't always manifested through physical violence, sometimes it rears its ugly head in more covert forms such as systemic racism. But whatever the case, it has no place in our society.\nOne thing we can do is to control the narrative. No longer should we tolerate those who criticise us for being too \"sensitive\" or tell us that it's not about race. There are those who have been privileged enough not to experience racism first-hand, but this isn't the case for everyone.\nIn Xie's case, the officers who were called to the scene of her attack claimed that they needed time to determine whether the incident was racially motivated. But through the eyes of victims like Xie, we know the truth.\nVictims of race hate crime should never give up their power to speak the truth, fight for the truth, and\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "llama3", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": null}}
