Even if a reporter approached me, without my wife\u2019s consent, I wouldn\u2019t be able to talk about her ordeal until she, the victim, feels comfortable. After my wife made phone calls to these defense leagues and community centers, she ran into misunderstandings, rudeness, and poor follow ups. She was told at one point there aren\u2019t enough criminal laws and we were told the attorneys available don\u2019t handle this type of case. After many phone calls and circling emails, we found ourselves back at the drawing table. Later I learned these public defense funds and community associations aren\u2019t always inadequately funded and under staffed.\nDuring the time of crisis, my wife\u2019s case was being brushed aside.\nMore and more we felt there was a desperation for media exposure, but not from us, but from those who wanted to help us.
