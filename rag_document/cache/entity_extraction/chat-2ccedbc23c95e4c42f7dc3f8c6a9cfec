In our state, we are proudly home to 350,000 AAPI residents. According to an open letter condemning coronavirus-fueled racism that was organized by the Ohio Progressive Asian Women's Leadership and signed by over 100 Ohio organizations, children across Ohio have recently experienced increased bullying based on their AAPI heritage.\nTragically, we know from examples like that involving Emilie Olsen \u2013 a 13-year-old Chinese American girl from Fairfield who committed suicide in 2014 after being bullied in part based on her heritage \u2013 that such harassment can have deadly consequences.\nHamilton County is also not immune. According to the FBI, of all major cities in Ohio, Cincinnati recently had the highest per capita rate of reported hate crimes, with 30 incidents in 2018 alone. Given that hate crimes are notoriously underreported, it is almost certain that more are occurring.\nI know from my experience prosecuting hate crimes when I was a federal prosecutor, that Hamilton County has seen its fair share of them. Sadly, we have also looked the other way, such as when a Cincinnati jury acquitted an attacker for the tragic beating and murder of Vincent Chin\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "llama3", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": null}}
