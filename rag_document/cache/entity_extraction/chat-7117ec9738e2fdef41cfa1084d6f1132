Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: One of the following types: [organization,person,geo,event]\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\n Format each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3.

For New York the problem endures as the city forges ahead with its reopening and visitors once again wander the streets of Chinatown - and many living in the neighborhood say they feel left behind.\n\nBut for New York's police stopping the attacks before they happen is particularly difficult - even when the person accused has dozens of prior arrests. And even when arrests are made the defendants are often released pending trial corrections records show. Chappell for example was released just a few days after his arrest despite prosecutors seeking high bail. \"It's nice to know there's a task force. It's nice to go on the bus and there's this messaging of anti-Asian hate crimes\" said Kevin Nadal a professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice. \"But what does that actually do?\"\n\nThe challenges continue even as anti-Asian violence keeps rising: As of June 27 reported hate crimes against Asian New Yorkers had increased by 400% compared with the same time frame in 2020 from 21 to 105 according to Police Department statistics.
