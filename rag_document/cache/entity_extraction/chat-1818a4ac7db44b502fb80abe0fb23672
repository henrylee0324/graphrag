Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: One of the following types: [organization,person,geo,event]\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\n Format each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3.

The Army Corps of Engineers in April spent $876,000 converting it into a hospital for a possible surge of coronavirus patients, but it's sat empty since.\nThe first incarcerated woman has died from what appears to be coronavirus complications. If confirmed, she'd be the 14th state inmate death linked to the virus.\nAn Asian American exercising at a Torrance Park was the target of a lengthy, racist tirade captured on video: \"This is not your place. This is not your home.\"\nThe San Francisco police union tells the city's transportation agency in a Tweet to \"lose our number\" next time it has problems with passengers. The agency previously had said it would no longer transport police to anti-police brutality protests.\nUnemployment claims are down, but is that a good thing?\nThe news on the surface sounds good: Unemployment claims are going down and/or being denied because more people are returning to work and earning more money.\nThen you dig deeper.\nThere, you'll see that going back to work, for many people, means taking home less than they did when they weren't working, because of the additional $600 in federal unemployment they would miss out on. And the situation is hurting already disadvantaged workers the most.\nThose are some findings from UCLA's California Policy Lab's unemployment analysis released Thursday.
