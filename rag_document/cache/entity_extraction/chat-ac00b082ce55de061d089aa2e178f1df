Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: One of the following types: [organization,person,geo,event]\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\n Format each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3.

We have shied away from taking responsibility for our complicity in systems of power. (Although some Asian Americans have also been fiercely progressive advocates for racial and economic justice, even beyond our own little corner.)\nAs many writers and thinkers of colour have pointed out, it feels almost unbearably lopsided that white Americans can be so mediocre at ally-ship, while the rest of us flagellate each other and ourselves for not caring enough, not doing enough. The temptation to opt out altogether is strong. This might feel especially true, as we struggle with a kind of solidarity that feels completely unintuitive: physical retreat.\nThat\u2019s why it\u2019s so important to keep reminding ourselves that coronavirus racism is far from unique. It\u2019s the same kind of hate that erupted after 9/11, aimed at Muslims and South Asians; it\u2019s the hate that black Americans have been enduring for centuries. Asian Americans\u2019 fixation on Asian-specific racism elides the bigger story.\nIn November \u2014 about a month and a half before doctors in Wuhan first identified the virus \u2014 the FBI released a report from 2018 showing that hate crimes involving physical assault were at a 16-year high. Vandalism was down; violence was up. Black Americans, as usual, bore the brunt of most hate crimes.\nScapegoating works\nNotably, there was also a significant upswing in violence against Latinos, on the heels of Trump\u2019s brutal rhetoric over undocumented immigrants\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "llama3", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": null}}
