The root cause was the practice of feeding cattle a \"protein\" mixture made from other cattle who died from the disease and sheep infected with a related condition called scrapie. When the disease jumped to humans, it killed 177 people.\nThere was no racist backlash against the British, at least not that I recall. The outbreak was widely regarded as a misfortune.\nAfter news broke about the latest racist attack aboard a Vancouver bus, North Vancouver MLA Bowinn Ma, whose parents immigrated to Canada from Taiwan, posted a heartfelt message on Twitter articulating her thoughts on anti-Asian racism, which she points out exists worldwide.\nThe problem with high-profile people such as Mr. Trump and Mr. Adams playing the blame game is it emboldens others to \"embrace their biases, their prejudices and ignorant ideas about other people as though they are righteous,\" Ms. Ma says.
