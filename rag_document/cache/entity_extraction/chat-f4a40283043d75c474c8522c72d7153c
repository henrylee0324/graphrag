Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: One of the following types: [organization,person,geo,event]\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\n Format each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3.

Twenty-one of these incidents have been confirmed as hate-related, and 17 were motivated by anti-Asian and COVID-19 biases.\nOf the 11 cases not yet confirmed as hate-related, six were alleged anti-Asian and COVID-19 incidents. One recently reported offense involved a group of perpetrators who yelled COVID-19 related slurs at an Asian man before assaulting him and stealing his car.\n\"They've been blamed for starting the pandemic. People have been physically pushed or assaulted, especially if they were wearing masks. Basically, the Asian communities do not feel safe because they say that they are receiving threats,\" Landau said.\nGoodman has heard the same kinds of reports.\n\"What we've heard from friends in the Asian American community is someone will hear someone was attacked or yelled at outside and that makes them afraid to go out for necessary things,\" she said.\nGoodman and Landau noted the African American community has experienced racism for wearing masks: Black men are likely to be viewed with suspicion and fear if they cover their faces, even if they are doing so in compliance with safety regulations.\nThe ADL and PCHR have distributed materials with instructions on reporting hate crimes and bias incidents.
