Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: One of the following types: [organization,person,geo,event]\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\n Format each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3.

Not a soul. I never even realized these incidents were hate crimes until well into my 20s. \nI grew up in the 1990s in Philadelphia, and my family simply did not have a language for racism. I was never taught about microaggressions, white privilege, or institutionalized racism. All I knew was the constant feeling of discomfort, insecurity, and threat, but never understanding why. \nThis was further undermined by peers and adults, who gaslit my emotions by stating \"it was all a joke\" or calling my tears \"overly sensitive.\" Teachers, bus drivers, and my peers' parents, who often witnessed others openly screaming racial slurs and taunts, never said a word. These adults colluded to instill an atmosphere of silence and indifference. \nI accepted this racism because I didn't know any different. This was my normal. I truly never understood that I as a person my culture, my language, and my community - deserved to be respected. \nA significant reason why I lacked the language was I didn't know the history of my people.
