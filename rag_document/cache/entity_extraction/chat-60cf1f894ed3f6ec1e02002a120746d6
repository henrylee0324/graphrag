While the guide repeatedly stresses the importance of religious freedom, it fails\nto mention equality and non-discrimination as fundamental rights. This selective presentation of key human\nrights protections gives prospective citizens a distorted picture.\nThe guide also misses the opportunity to endorse key human rights protections against racism, which are\ncentral to mitigating the effects of systemic discrimination on people's well-being, financial security, education\nand work aspirations.\nAdditionally ignored are past and contemporary policies that undermine the rights of racialized migrant\nworkers. Examples of these groups include Black migrants, who historically were only admitted as domestic\nworkers or in other menial roles; Filipino workers recruited to be home care aides and personal support\nworkers; and Latin American and Caribbean migrant farm workers today. Racialized migrants are frequently\ndenied landed immigrant status, family reunification, provincial health coverage, unemployment benefits,\nworkplace protections and other social entitlements and worker protections.\nA replacement citizenship guide is long overdue.
