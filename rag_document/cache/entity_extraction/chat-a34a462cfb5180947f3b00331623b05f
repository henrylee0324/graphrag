That is what is difficult for the US to accept.\" Or, as Elon Musk recently said, \"I'm very confident the future of China is going to be great.\" \nBy presenting China as an aggressor, the US gives itself cover for taking unilateral actions to try to stem China's rise. This demonising of China might feed nationalistic impulses, but it will not help find common ground or build the required trust to ensure China and the US can peacefully coexist. \nBy contrast, China is non-confrontational. As State Councillor Yang Jiechi said after the talks in Anchorage, Alaska, \"The two sides should follow the policy of 'no conflict' to guide our path towards a healthy and stable trajectory moving forward.\" \nAlthough US President Joe Biden has spoken eloquently in condemning violence against Asians, the language of the US government still emphasises Chinese aggression. Deliberately or not, this encourages violence against Asians. China-bashing in any form on Capitol Hill inspires actual Asian-American bashing in our streets. Conversely, showing tolerance and respect towards China will inspire tolerance and respect towards Asian-Americans, and this will make our cities safer. \nThese days, my wife doesn't leave our flat alone.
