Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: One of the following types: [organization,person,geo,event]\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\n Format each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3.

The circumstances are grim, disheartening, and sadly unsurprising in a country where our last president stoked the fire by calling COVID the \"China- virus,\" which encouraged what looked to me to be a bipartisan blame toward Wuhan on the entire global pandemic.\nThe women killed came from a diverse background, not just China- I'm writing about that country specifically because that's been my personal experience. With \"Stop Asian Hate\" though, I focused on the word \"hate\" rather than \"violence.\" The movement sparked within me these long-held bitter feelings I've felt about so many people around me who are supposedly progressive, but carry these racial biases as if it's common and fine. It isn't.\nIf you're reading this column for the first time today, I am supposed to write about local cocktails and nightlife. So I'm sorry-but just a little bit-that I took such a sharp turn into rant territory. I hope you've reached out with kindness to Asian friends recently, and if you don't have any, go make one today. Support your Asian businesses. Be thoughtful of how you treat others.\nI end today with a Chinese Mai Tai, which I first experienced at Li Po Cocktail Lounge (916 Grant Ave.) many years ago. They're closed now, so I found this recipe in an archived story from 2012 that the San Francisco Examiner did on their famous cocktail\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "llama3", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": null}}
