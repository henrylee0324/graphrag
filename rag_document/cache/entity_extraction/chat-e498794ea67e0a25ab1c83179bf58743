Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: One of the following types: [organization,person,geo,event]\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\n Format each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3.

At least four victims were of Korean origin. While I was born in this country and I'm proud to be an American I am half Korean and half Japanese.\nIt is unclear whether the shooting victims were targeted because of their race. Cherokee County Sheriff Frank Reynolds said Wednesday that the suspect Robert Aaron Long 21 of Woodstock Georgia claimed that his actions weren't racially motivated and that he had a sexual addiction. \nI find it unsettling nevertheless because it comes at a time when anti-Asian sentiment and violence are on the rise in our country. Some blame people who look like me of being responsible for the so-called China virus more accurately known as the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19. \nIn the early months of the pandemic last year one woman on Facebook commenting on an article I wrote as business editor of The Daytona Beach News-Journal told me that I was a nothing who should go back to China. \nAnd I am not the only one. \nI recently interviewed a Daytona Beach Florida area family that runs a Korean restaurant. They told me they were being similarly harassed on nearly a daily basis both by people showing up in person to place orders and then refusing to pay for them as well as those calling them on the phone during their busy dinner rush.\n'I'm\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "llama3", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": null}}
