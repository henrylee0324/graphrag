Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: One of the following types: [organization,person,geo,event]\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\n Format each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3.

Stop AAPI Hate was started by my organization, the Asian Pacific Policy and Planning Council (A3PCON), Chinese for Affirmative Action, and San Francisco State University's Asian\nAmerican Studies Department in March 2020 after we began to see a surge of incidents against our community\nmembers in California and across the country. Since we launched, we have received over 2,700 incident reports\nfrom 47 states and the District of Columbia.\nStop AAPI Hate has received firsthand reports of verbal attacks against grandparents walking their infant\ngrandchild, civil rights violations like workplace discrimination against a doctor and a case of refusal of service\nagainst a young woman in a grocery store, and even physical assaults against students in school and parents at\na pharmacy.\nIn the past and present, the AAPI community are treated like perpetual foreigners. Yet, America is our country.\nMany of us were born here. And others like me came when we were children. We are U.S. citizens and the\nfastest growing electorate of any racial or ethnic group, according to the Pew Research Group. In this year's\nelection, eleven million of us are eligible to vote, making up 5% of the nation's eligible voters. But, in order for\nus to be counted and for issues of concern to us to matter to elected leaders, we must vote.\nHowever, according to AAPI Data, only 56% of Asian Americans eligible to vote were registered\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "llama3", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": null}}
