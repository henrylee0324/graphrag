Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: One of the following types: [organization,person,geo,event]\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\n Format each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3.

This guide is a\nreference to help understand and appropriately use language related to health equity, primarily\nas it pertains to race, ethnicity, structural racism and social determinants of health. You can also\nfind shorter definitions in the glossary, and common usage for names of groups and populations\nin the quick reference. For further guidance about equity-related language outside this focus,\nplease see the AHA Editorial Style Guide.

(References are linked, footnoted and/or\nlisted at the end of this document.) Because language evolves, this guide will be continually\nupdated.
