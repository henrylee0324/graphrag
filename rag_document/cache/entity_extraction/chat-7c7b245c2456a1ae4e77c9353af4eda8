Many other economies, such as the European Union,\nhave effectively flattened, even lowered the curve after suffering a heavy blow. Yet the world's only superpower\ncontinues to set single-day records - it registered more than 60,000 new cases on Tuesday.\nThat's why US politicians have intensified their attacks against China, often using racist language, in campaign rallies, on TV and social media, in a bid to deflect public criticism.\nSadly, resorting to such racist rhetoric is regarded as a good strategy by some Republicans to appeal to the\nvoters. The fact that many supporters in campaign rallies cheered the leaders who used racist language should\nshock the world, especially after worldwide anti-racism protests sparked by the death of African American\nGeorge Floyd due to police brutality in Minnesota on May 25.\nThe racist slurs relished by top US officials are also partly responsible for the increasing discrimination and\nattacks against Asian Americans. A Pew survey released on July 1 showed that about four in 10 US adults say it\nhas become more common for people to express racist views against Asians since the pandemic broke out.\nHowever\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "llama3", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": null}}
