About whether America was finally ready to stop Asian hate.\nTao was a journalist before immigrating to America, and she knows the truth is more complex than that. The truth is Tao was in San Francisco for her 20th wedding anniversary a few years ago when a woman kicked her luggage and told her to go back to her country.\nShe hasn't experienced overt racism like that in Cincinnati.

She is an advocate who knows Asian people are underrepresented in Cincinnati media, including The Enquirer.\nShe knows this because she is the one sending press releases that often go unanswered.
