Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: One of the following types: [organization,person,geo,event]\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\n Format each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3.

One common theme has been worries about\nmainland Chinese overrunning and infecting local populations.\nIn Singapore and Malaysia, hundreds of thousands have signed petitions demanding a total ban on Chinese nationals entering their countries; in response, both countries\u2019 governments have implemented some form of entry ban. In Japan, some have dubbed the Chinese \u201cbio-terrorists,\u201d while conspiracy theories about the Chinese infecting locals, particularly Muslims, have predominated in Indonesia and elsewhere.\nIt is crystal clear that the flourishing prosperity of the Chinese has also culminated in ever-increasing numbers of tourists and students visiting and living in numerous parts of the world, resulting in their increased visibility on the ground. Reports of sporadic\ncrude behavior, combined with their sheer numbers, have given rise to the stereotype of Chinese tourists as boors or Chinese students as ultra-rich.\nOf course, Sinophobia is not ubiquitous, as populations in South America, Africa, and Eastern Europe view China more positively, according to the Pew Center for Research.\n\u201cIn recent years, a remarkable amount of anti-China sentiment has originated in the U.S., especially under the Trump administration,\u201d said Professor Barry Sautman, a sociologist at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology.
