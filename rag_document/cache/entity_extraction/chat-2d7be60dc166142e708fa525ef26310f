The ignorance of people, allied with the philosophy of Trumpism, has given rise to the anti-Asian racism. Their narrative may also include references to the Chinese Communist political system and Chinese oligarchy. These detrimental opinions are red herrings and should have no place within the context of anti-Asian racism. \nInstead, we need to stop this cycle of hate toward those who are different from ourselves. Stop the labelling of others, eliminate the negative stereotypes; stop the microaggressions! We need to come together in solidarity and break the exclusivity barriers to create a supportive, welcoming, caring society - one where we are all treated with dignity, respect, and equity as human beings. \nWe need to move beyond our statements, Black Lives Matter, Stop Asian Hate; we need to take a stand and be bold. These actions can range from checking in with your Asian friends on their well-being. Are they feeling safe in our community? Listening to other racialized groups, hearing their narratives, educating yourselves, being bold and taking a stand against hate. \nEven small acts of kindness give us hope, energy, and the opportunity for conversations.
