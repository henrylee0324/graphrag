Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: One of the following types: [organization,person,geo,event]\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\n Format each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3.

Or is the person worth your time? We encourage the students to stay connected with their mentors to talk about their feelings and get practical suggestions on what to do.\"\nIf bullying is conducted online, for example, Apex suggests young people should unfollow and report the bully or speak out. If someone is being taunted in person, a bystander could stand beside them for moral support or help the victim leave the scene. If they feel comfortable, they could speak out - but focus on the idea or behaviour, not the instigator of the attack.\nApex also encourages young people to point out that the coronavirus pandemic has nothing to do with ethnicity, or, if they know the person, engage in a conversation, Chung says. They are also encouraged to take care of themselves by exercising regularly, meditating, or finding a creative outlet through which to channel their emotions.\nApex has worked with thousands of students of Chinese, Korean, Japanese and South Asian descent since it was founded in New York in 1992 by dentist Alex Tsui and four of his Asian-American friends. Their aim was to help families from similar ethnic and cultural backgrounds to theirs.\nApex mentors are carefully chosen in a rigorous process that includes several interviews; Jason's mentor, 28-year-old Elvin Yuen, says it took at least six months for him to be accepted.
