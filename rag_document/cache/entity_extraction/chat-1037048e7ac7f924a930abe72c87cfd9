Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: One of the following types: [organization,person,geo,event]\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\n Format each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3.

I worry about the racist and sexualized harassment they will endure once we emerge from this pandemic and they leave our home. The one consolation I have is that they have better answers for anyone who questions their credentials as Americans. My husband is a fifth- generation American of Chinese descent. His great-great grandparents were among the Chinese who immigrated to Honolulu and San Francisco more than 100 years ago. \nI can't wait until someone tries to ask my daughters where they are REALLY from and then try to ask about their parents, grandparents, and great-grandparents. Yet I also know that our faces mark us as perpetual foreigners in America, no matter how many generations of our family have lived here. \nSome of what I've shared here will resonate with my Latinx brothers and sisters. Yet I recognize my experiences and concerns pale in comparison to my friends who worry about police and other armed individuals violently threatening their sons and daughters.
