Systemic discrimination against Asian-Americans has persisted for years, she said. \nWhat happened in the past year is not only just because of the pandemic, or hate rhetoric, Ms. Cheng said. All of this can be rooted back in history. \nMs. Cheng and four other panelists will give a presentation on Asian-American discrimination and have an open dialogue at a virtual town-hall discussion Tuesday. The program, Stop Anti-Asian Hate, The Fight to Eliminate Racism in All Forms, will tackle systemic and institutionalized discrimination against Asian-Americans, and look at some of the problem's roots, Ms. Cheng said. \nAccording to Stop Hate AAPI, an activist organization that labels itself as a reporting center created to track and respond to hate crimes against Asian-Americans and Pacific Islanders in the United States, 3,795 reports of hate incidents were documented in the country during the 12 months that ended with February. It's a number that doesn't take into account for other hateful incidents that aren't even classified as hate crimes. \nIt's very difficult to prosecute hate crimes, Ms. Cheng said. But it doesn't mean that hate crimes don't exist or prejudice \nagainst Asian-Americans doesn't exist. \nWe would like to increase the dialogue, she added. Because of the violence against Asian-Americans, particularly to the most vulnerable groups like elders, the Asian-American community is starting to feel like we need to stand up.\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "llama3", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": null}}
