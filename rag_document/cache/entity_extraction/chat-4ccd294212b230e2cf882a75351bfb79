Josue David Cisneros, professor at University of Illinois at Urbana- Champaign, has studied this phenomenon.\n\"It is not surprising that a new disease leads to public fear, stigma, and the scapegoating of certain kinds of people because we tend to understand these events through our past disease rhetoric, which is rooted in fear, stigma, scapegoating,\" Cisneros told Business Insider.\n\"Some of the US' first immigration laws were targeting Chinese immigrants because they were seen as racial, cultural, and biological threats, for example the Chinese Exclusion Act,\" Cisneros said. \"Perceived biological threat is tied to a perceived cultural threat.\"\nA recent example is President Trump's 2018 speech where he said undocumented immigrants \"infest\" the US. Cisneros added that anti-Chinese rhetoric, in particular, dates back to the 19th century, and has continued even as recently as the SARS outbreak in 2003 and the swine flu outbreak of 2009.\nLehigh University researchers found, for example, that media coverage of the SARS outbreak propagated negative images of Asians, which in turn led to \"detrimental\" emotional effects.\n\"Rather than focusing on relief efforts by the government and actions taken to contain the epidemic, mainstream media chose to simply expose and repeatedly accuse\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "llama3", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": null}}
