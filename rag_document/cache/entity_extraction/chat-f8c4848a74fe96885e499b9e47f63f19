Yet I recognize my experiences and concerns pale in comparison to my friends who worry about police and other armed individuals violently threatening their sons and daughters. I think this is why I, as an American of Asian descent, never felt like I could speak up about these relatively minor incidents knowing other BIPOC communities have had devastating stories of racism that led to much deeper and long-lasting pain. \nEach individual incident I've recounted is like a small cut not enough to sever an artery but enough to cause some pain and make us fear what might come next. \nI know Asian American and Pacific Islanders are often portrayed as highly successful professionals because we are over- represented in many elite spheres. That is also a result of a skewed immigration system that severely restricted immigration from Asia until 1965, when then opened the doors to highly educated immigrants. The preferential treatment meant that top scientists, engineers, medical professionals, and other highly educated folks were over-represented in the immigrant communities from the Asia Pacific region. \nYet there have been Filipino, Chinese, Indian, Japanese, Korean, and other immigrants from Asia since before the U.S. was a nation. Our history in the U.S. is also seeped in the blood of victims of violence - Chinatowns were burned and Chinese men lynched during the Gold Rush days, Vincent Chin was murdered in 1982 because out-of-work auto workers thought he\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "llama3", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": null}}
