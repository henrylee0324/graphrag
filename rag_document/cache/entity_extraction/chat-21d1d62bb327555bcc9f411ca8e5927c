Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: One of the following types: [organization,person,geo,event]\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\n Format each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3.

Lawmakers in the past week have echoed the same sentiment, reminding people that this is nothing new.\n\"It's senseless,\" said Kim -- a word she falls back on repeatedly.\nFor many in the Asian community, making sense of this violence and the motives behind each incident feels futile. The rise in violence against Asians has generally been attributed to racist rhetoric surrounding the pandemic, but not all crimes have been labeled as hate crimes.\nThat includes the shooting deaths in Atlanta by the suspect Robert Aaron Long, a 21-year-old white man who told police his sex addiction compelled him to attack two spas that he frequented. Police have not yet determined that Long \"specifically targeted\" his victims, but experts say it is hard to separate the crime from race.\nAuthorities say the suspect opened fire at Young's Asian Massage in Acworth, Georgia on Tuesday evening, killing four people and injuring a fifth, before driving 30 miles into Atlanta and killing four more people at two businesses, Gold Spa and Aromatherapy Spa. Long was arrested about 150 miles south of Atlanta. Police said he was heading to Florida and intended to carry out more shootings at spas there.\nOne thing is certain: Many Asian Americans are left with a feeling of vulnerability, a feeling that increases each time someone of Asian descent is assaulted on the streets or killed.\nEach story is a harbinger of what could come.\nKim, who attends a local Asian church in Savannah, says her whole congregation is scared.
