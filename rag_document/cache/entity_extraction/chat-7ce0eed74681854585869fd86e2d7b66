Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: One of the following types: [organization,person,geo,event]\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\n Format each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3.

This routine involves visualising their sleeping environment - the bed, the bedsheet, the pillow - to ease them into the act of sleeping. Mobiles should be kept away from the bed and fragrant lotions and music should be used. Rajkumari Daga, a 57-year-old homemaker from Mumbai is following a \"no coffee after 7 and dinner by 8\" routine to revert to her normal sleep cycle of 11 pm to 7 am which has gone for a toss in the last three months, she says. Shalini L, a Mumbai-based marketing professional, listens to music from meditation apps like Calm and Headspace to quell her sleeping anxiety. \"Since mid-March, as news of the global health crisis steadily increased, Headspace saw a 33% increase in its sleep music usage over the last 30 days of usage,\" says Rich Pierson, the CEO & cofounder of Headspace.
