Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: One of the following types: [organization,person,geo,event]\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\n Format each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3.

Why would he specifically seek out Asian spas, Asian-owned spas, Asian-run spas in three different locations in order to kill Asian women if race isn't a factor? That to me is clearly a hate crime against Asians and Asian women in particular. It has nothing to do with sex addiction. Lots of people are saying these are sex workers. I was a sex worker. I know what sex work is. This to me seems more likeskin care and aestheticians. The women were mostly 50, 60, 70. This was not a typical idea of what people think of as sex workers or Asian sex workers. The framing of this as a crime by a sex addict who wanted to kill sex workers, it's not exactly that. There's a lot of projection happening onto this crime that has to do with the inherent racism that exists in society around Asian \nwomen. \n\"I'm grateful to the hashtags #StopAAPIHate and #StopAsianHate.
