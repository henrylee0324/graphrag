I am really worried not enough is being done for them.\" \nThis past April, protesters took the subway system to loudly express their concern and to distribute safety messages to passengers recently. \n\"We are outraged that Asian Americans are being attacked both above and below ground. And to make matters worse, bystanders are watching us get attacked with complete indifference. This is absolutely unacceptable! Asian American are human beings, and we should be treated as such.
