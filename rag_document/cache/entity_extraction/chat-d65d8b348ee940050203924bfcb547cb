Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: One of the following types: [organization,person,geo,event]\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\n Format each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3.

Rather than merely a challenge of national defence, as the PM suggests, this pandemic also presents one of reconstruction.\nHaving pulled up the drawbridge for now, there's a risk of our national sentiment becoming too insular, too defensive. What's needed isn't so much a rallying cry of sovereignty, but of nation-building. If we need trust, it's not only trust in government, it's trust among citizens.\nThe kind of nation we rebuild - the kind of social contract we re-enact - will be determined not just by government, but by us as citizens. In these extraordinary times, almost all our lives have grown more ordinary. The little things, the gestures and exchanges between us, have taken on new meaning. All the more reason to stamp out the racism, often\ninsidious, creeping into the lives of many Australians.\nTim Soutphommasane is a political theorist and professor at the University of Sydney. He was Race Discrimination Commissioner from 2013 to 2018. Minorities rarely fare well during pandemics.\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "llama3", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": null}}
