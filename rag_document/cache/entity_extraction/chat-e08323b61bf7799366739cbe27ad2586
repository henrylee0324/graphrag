Conducted online March 18-25, the survey also revealed that more than one-quarter of Asian Americans report having been victims of such crimes at some point in their lives. Asian Americans normally report lower levels of hate crimes than Black Americans, but this year the two \ngroups are on par. \nThe survey also confirmed the microaggressions that Asian Americans routinely face: being asked where they \nare from, with the assumption that they are foreign-born; being encouraged to Americanize or \"whiten\" their names; having their names intentionally mispronounced; and even being spit or coughed upon. That last form of abuse is telling, as the recent wave of attacks has been linked to the xenophobia stirred up by former President Trump early on in the COVID-19 crisis. His use of hate-inducing, finger-pointing language like \"the China virus\" and \"kung flu\" - without bothering to distinguish between the policies of the Chinese government and the innocent lives of Asian Americans, many of whom aren't even of Chinese descent - stirred up this ugly surge. \nBut the anti-Asian bias has endured even with Trump gone from Twitter and the White House. In New York City alone this week, footage emerged first of an Asian American man beaten and choked on a subway train, then of a 65-year-old Filipino American churchgoer kicked repeatedly in the head and upper body in front of a residential building\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "llama3", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": null}}
