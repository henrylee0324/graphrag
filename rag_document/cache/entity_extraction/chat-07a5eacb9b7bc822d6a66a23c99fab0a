Subscribe here.\nA white, 21-year-old man has been charged with killing eight people, including six Asian women, at several Atlanta-area massage parlors. The gunman faces eight counts of murder and one count of aggravated assault. Police continue to investigate the motive behind the shootings, but the bloody attacks happened against the backdrop of rising violence against Asian Americans across the US.\nGeorgia Sen. Dr. Michelle Au told The World that Asian American communities are on edge. \u201cThe bigger picture is that we've had a huge rise in violent acts, discriminatory acts, against Asian Americans. And in this milieu, having this incident happen in our communities really shakes people to their core and people are scared,\u201d Au said.\nThe gunman told police that Tuesday\u2019s murders were not racially motivated, but the statement is being received with skepticism given the locations and the fact that six of the eight victims were women of Asian descent.\nAu said hate crimes against Asian Americans have been on the rise for the past year as the coronavirus pandemic hit the US but have been widely underreported. She wants to raise awareness of the magnitude of these types of hate crimes.\n\u201cWhat I would like to do just to start is to raise awareness of it regionally so that we can increase safety for our communities and make it so that people in the community feel safer\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "llama3", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": null}}
