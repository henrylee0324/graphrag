Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: One of the following types: [organization,person,geo,event]\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\n Format each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3.

Asians were targeted in 28 hate crimes from Jan. 1 through March 25 of this year, compared with seven such crimes in the same period last year, according to the NYPD.\nWhile the number of hate crimes counted by the NYPD is relatively small compared with other crimes, officials believe hate crimes are underreported.\n\"Like much of America we've seen a disturbing spike in hate crimes targeting Asian-Americans in New York City,\" Mr. Shea said.\nNYPD officials said the types of hate crimes committed against Asians in the city have included assaults and harassment. The officials said motives for the crimes have varied, but suspects in several instances have been people experiencing homelessness or mental-health issues.\nOther U.S. cities, such as Los Angeles and Oakland, Calif., also have seen a rise in hate crimes targeting Asians, prompting people to form volunteer patrols in some communities. A series of shootings at spas in the Atlanta area on March 16 claimed the lives of eight people, six of whom were women of Asian descent.\nThe suspect in the attacks has been charged with eight counts of murder and one count of aggravated assault, officials said.\nWhile according to police the suspect said he targeted the businesses \"for providing an outlet for his addiction to sex,\" Atlanta Deputy Police Chief Charles Hampton Jr. said on March 18 that investigators were still considering\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "llama3", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": null}}
