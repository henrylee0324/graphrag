Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: One of the following types: [organization,person,geo,event]\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\n Format each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3.

Last week\u2019s horrific gunning down of eight people, including six women of Asian descent, at spas in the Atlanta area send a collective chill of fear and helplessness down the spine of Asian American communities.\nGroups like Stop AAPI Hate have vehemently denounced the violence, as have allies from several quarters. President Joe Biden, in his speech March 11 on the one-year anniversary of the shutdown, condemned hate and discrimination targeted at Asian Americans, wherein reported hate crimes had been rising before the Atlanta shootings. Rallying in and around the community through awareness and education is an appropriate response. But Asian Americans also need to focus on admitting openly that we are scared and suffering, and to seek urgent care for ourselves as a truly united Pan-Asian front. That means emotional support and deep caring for one another regardless of socioeconomic status or country of origin.\nThis may not come as easily as one might think. In a white-dominated society, Asian Americans have long had to live up to its model minority myth (stereotype) of achieving socioeconomic success fueled by \u201cgood at math\u201d academic achievement. But that narrative also erases our diversity and our working-class communities. It\u2019s not just blood, sweat, and tears that have driven us, but the false promise of assimilation as well \u2014 trying to blend in, as not to be the nail that gets hammered down. This double-edged sword translates into an alienating pressure to be nonconfrontational, hiding\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "llama3", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": null}}
