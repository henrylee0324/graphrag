So the verbal abuse against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders isn't contextualized and is often quickly dismissed by even Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders themselves. We cannot let our ignorance of the history of Asians and Pacific Islanders in the U.S. shield us from the racism that has hounded generations. \nDismissing the behavior because the offenders didn't cause physical harm means we don't acknowledge that there is still cumulative pain. Moreover, as we have all learned recently after the murders of six Asian American women who worked at the spas in Atlanta (as well as the murder of a white female customer and white male employee), strangers targeting Asian Americans can absolutely lead to horrific violence. (Editor note: Anna wrote this story prior to the shooting deaths of eight workers at a FedEx facility in Indianapolis, including four Sikhs). I think the behavior escalates when perpetrators get away \nwith the \"low-level hate.\" So I speak up today because I think we must critically examine the racist and sexualized verbal abuse many BIPOC women have endured and address how it impacts us all. \nFor the past year, while we battled COVID, Asian American and Pacific Islander women have endured a disproportionate share of that abuse, per the same Stop AAPI Hate report referenced earlier. We need to stop the normalization of verbal abuse against anyone and in particular, against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders in\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "llama3", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": null}}
