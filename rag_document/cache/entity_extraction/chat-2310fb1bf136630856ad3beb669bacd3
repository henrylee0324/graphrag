Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: One of the following types: [organization,person,geo,event]\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\n Format each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3.

Chesapeake resident Elizabeth Higgins heard what happened to the restaurant and decided she wanted to support it. Her son is a sous chef in Pennsylvania and she's heard of Chinese restaurants there seeing big declines in business during the coronavirus. As the orders kept coming in Monday, Higgins said she waited for more than an hour for her order of chicken chow mein and orange chicken.\n\"Right now, it's best to support the local businesses,\" she said.\nSgueglia is encouraging people to \"spread the love\" throughout the week, as she doesn't want to overwhelm the restaurant. She plans to be out for the tailgate Monday from 6 to 8 p.m. with some music and chairs. She had plans to gather money in red envelopes to give to Cheng and her husband.\nSgueglia, who owns a real estate and property management firm in Chesapeake, got to know Cheng over the years. Sgueglia hosts exchange students who attend private schools around Hampton Roads and the students are picked up and dropped off in the parking lot where Taste of China is located.
