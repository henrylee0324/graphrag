Many people grew up hearing the derogatory language used to describe Asians as \"chinks\", \"Japs\", \"nips\", \"slants\", \"gooks\", \"sand Niggers\", \"dune coons\", \"Chinaman\", \"camel jockeys\", \"dots\", \"VCs\", and many other names. These are most common among white Americans, but these words and stereotypes have been around for 150 years. There have been anti-Asian riots and massacres in America-all done by whites whom Asians favor over more tolerant Black and Brown Americans. The Civil Rights that Asians enjoy were fought for and earned by Blacks whom they hate, and these same rights were denied to them by whites who they love. The Martinican psychiatrist Frantz Fanon described colonized people who worshipped those that oppressed them as having \"dark skin white mask\". A major solution I would like to suggest to solving the Asian American crisis is for them to stop being either passive or active supporters of white racism. \nAsians have either had a free ride in American life leaving the heavy lifting of the racial cross to the Blacks they loath so much or actively helped make life harder for people who have not bombed them in Asia nor oppressed them in America. The Asian Americans' Stockholm syndrome days are over and they must sober up to the reality that the way that they have conducted their affairs in America, Africa, and Latin America\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "llama3", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": null}}
