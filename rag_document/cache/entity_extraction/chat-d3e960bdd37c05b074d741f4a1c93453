Identify all entities.

That represents roughly 1.4 million more people.\nAmong Asian Americans, those symptoms increased from 28 percent to 34 percent, a change that represents an increase of about 800,000 people.\nThe data comes from an emergency weekly survey of U.S. households launched by the Census Bureau at the end of April to measure the pandemic's effects on finances,\nhousing, education and health. In the most recent data release, more than 1 million households were contacted through email and text, and more than 100,000 responded,\ncreating a robust sample size for the findings. Analysis of the data was conducted by multiple federal agencies including the Census Bureau and the Centers for Disease Control\nand Prevention's National Center for Health Statistics.\nIncluded in the 20-minute survey - called the Household Pulse Survey - were questions from two screening tools used by doctors to help determine whether patients might have\nmajor depressive disorder or generalized anxiety disorder. The results provide a real-time window into the country's collective mental health.\nData collected in 2019, released two weeks ago by the CDC, allows for the most accurate comparison to date of America's mental health from before the pandemic to after.\nAnd that comparison is stark: Rates of depression and anxiety symptoms have more than tripled since the coronavirus hit.\nBut the increases have hit black Americans especially hard.\n\"When we think about the impact of covid-19 among black Americans and other\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "llama3", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": null}}
