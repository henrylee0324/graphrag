A few onlookers, including two security guards, watched the attack and did nothing. This assault took place just weeks after the killings of eight people - six of them Asian women - in Atlanta, Georgia. \nAlthough anti-Asian bias has been around in the US since our nation was founded, there has been a surge of hate crimes against Asians since 2020. What is at the heart of this violence? It might have started with former US president Donald Trump's racist depictions of Covid-19 as the \"China virus\", but it has been perpetuated by labelling China as aggressive. \nIn Japan, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken warned against \"coercion and aggression\" by Beijing, saying the US would \"push back if necessary\". Deputy Defence Secretary Kathleen Hicks recently said Beijing \"has adopted a more coercive and aggressive approach\". \nIs China actually an aggressive country? The US has hundreds of active military bases around the world, perhaps more foreign military bases than any other nation or empire in history. Meanwhile, Beijing has just one military base outside China, in Djibouti. \nClearly, China is not an aggressor. In fact, historically China has been the victim of aggression by Japanese and Western forces, so much so that the Chinese refer to the 100 years ending with World War II as the \"century of humiliation\".
