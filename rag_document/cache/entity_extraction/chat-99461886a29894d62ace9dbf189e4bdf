It must stop. And it is on all of us, all of us together, to make it stop,\" Biden said in March, after meeting leaders and state lawmakers from the Asian-American and Pacific Islander community following the Atlanta shooting. \nHe was accompanied by vice-president Kamala Harris, the first Asian-American holder of the office in US history. \nHarris likened it to the targeting of Muslims after the September 11, 2001, attacks. She said, \"Racism is real in America, and it has always been. Xenophobia is real in America, and always has been. Sexism, too.\" \n\"The president and I will not be silent. We will not stand by. We will always speak out against violence, hate crimes and discrimination wherever and whenever it occurs,\" Harris added. \nHate crimes against Asian Americans increased by 149 per cent in 2020 in 16 major cities compared with 2019, according to the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism. \nThe violent incidents included people being slashed with a box cutter, being set on fire and subjected to verbal harassment, according to testimony at a US congressional hearing on anti-Asian violence convened in March. \nLast week, New York City said it planned to deploy an all-Asian undercover police team and expand community outreach in more than 200 languages to combat a rise in hate crimes against the community\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "llama3", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": null}}
