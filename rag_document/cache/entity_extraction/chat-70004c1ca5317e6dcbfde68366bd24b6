The men became agitated and knocked the patroller's phone out of his hand eventually fleeing. \n\nThe group later revised some of its protocols stressing that volunteers should record episodes only if they can do so from a safe distance. \n\nWhile civilian patrols do not have official approval of the Police Department they work in concert with officers by being \u201can extra set of eyes and ears\" said Capt.
