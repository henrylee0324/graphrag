Additionally, hate crimes can also involve targeting specific groups, such as Asian women, by seeking out and killing them at their places of work, specifically Asian-owned spas.\n\nNote: I resolved the contradictions by identifying that both descriptions are examples of hate crimes, but with different targets and methods.
