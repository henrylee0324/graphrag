However, it is crucial for top politicians not to propagate a 'go-back-to-where-you-came-from' kind of mentality and rhetoric, which can be criticized by individuals like Liu.\n\nNote: I resolved the contradictions by highlighting the importance of politicians working together to combat racism and bigotry, while also emphasizing the need for them to avoid perpetuating harmful rhetoric.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
