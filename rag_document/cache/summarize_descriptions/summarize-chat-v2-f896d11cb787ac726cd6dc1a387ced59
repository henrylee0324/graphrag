This declaration was made in light of the rapidly spreading virus and its potential impact on public health worldwide. Additionally, the WHO recommends using generic descriptive terms like \"coronavirus\" instead of naming new infectious diseases after places, people, or animals. This approach aims to reduce stigma and promote clear communication about the outbreak.\n\nNote: I resolved the contradiction by combining the two descriptions into a single summary that provides context for the WHO's declaration and its recommendation on naming infectious diseases.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
