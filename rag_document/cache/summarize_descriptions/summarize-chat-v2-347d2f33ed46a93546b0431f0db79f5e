{"result": "Here is a comprehensive summary of the data provided:\n\n**GOVERNMENTS**\n\nGovernments have a critical role in ensuring access to essential services during times of crisis, such as quarantines or lockdowns. They are obligated to provide necessary information for the protection and promotion of rights, including the right to health. Governments should also guarantee paid sick and family leave to all workers, enabling them to take time off without losing pay.\n\nIn addition, governments have an obligation to protect the right to freedom of expression and provide necessary information for the protection and promotion of rights. They should ensure that all healthcare services related to COVID-19 are provided without stigma and discrimination of any kind, including on the grounds of sexual orientation and gender identity.\n\nFurthermore, governments should evaluate and modify measures used to enforce immigration laws, including court hearings and check-ins with authorities, during the time of the outbreak. They should also immediately suspend any water shutoffs for failure to pay, ensuring that discontinuing water services is incompatible with human rights and can be particularly harmful in the context of public health crises like the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nGovernments should not exploit the coronavirus pandemic to criminalize or obstruct the work of civil society organizations. Instead, they should take steps to address the gendered impacts of the pandemic, including education and job losses. Overall, governments have a responsibility to prioritize human rights and ensure that their responses to the pandemic are equitable, inclusive, and just.\n\nI hope this summary meets your requirements!
