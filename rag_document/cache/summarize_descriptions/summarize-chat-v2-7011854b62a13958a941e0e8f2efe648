It is also the birthplace and childhood home of Gabriel Chiu, who later moved to the US as a child. For one individual, Hong Kong is considered their second home, where they lived for a long time. However, it's also a city where racial bias exists, with some Hongkongers treating South Asian communities unfairly.\n\nHistorically, Hong Kong was a former British colony that reverted to Chinese rule in 1997 and has significant autonomy.
