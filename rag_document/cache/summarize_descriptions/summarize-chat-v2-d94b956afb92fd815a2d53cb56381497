While this historical context has shaped their current status, it's essential to note that not all aspects of Mexican society are defined by this past. In fact, many Mexicans support and appreciate the work of healthcare workers, recognizing the vital importance of their role in maintaining public health.\n\nHowever, some individuals within this population have misinformed fears about COVID-19 infections, which has led to unfortunate incidents of harassment and attacks on medical workers.
