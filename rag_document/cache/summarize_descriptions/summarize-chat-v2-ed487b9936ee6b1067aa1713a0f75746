The law suspended the immigration of Chinese laborers for 10 years, starting in 1882, and excluded women specifically in sexualized terms.\n\nThe Act was a notorious piece of legislation that excluded Chinese immigrants from entering the U.S., perpetuating xenophobia and racism. It was an unjust government policy that led to mass resistance from Chinese Americans. The law was enacted in 1882, prohibiting the immigration of Chinese laborers and restricting Chinese immigrants from entering the U.S. for 10 years.\n\nThe \"Chinese Exclusion Act\" was a historic event that banned Chinese immigration and barred those already here from becoming citizens.
