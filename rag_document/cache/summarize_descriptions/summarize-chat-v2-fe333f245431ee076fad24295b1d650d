This group has been affected by racial bias, hate crimes, and discrimination during the COVID-19 pandemic, with a 50% increase in news stories about coronavirus-related incidents. They have experienced pain, fear, stigma, and brutality due to societal reactions and xenophobic anxiety.\n\nAsians are not only targeted with racism and hostility but also stereotyped as spreading disease due to their food habits. The group has been marginalized and needs support and advocacy from non-Asian folks. They require unity against hate crimes and increasing violence at alarming rates since the beginning of the pandemic.\n\nThe Asian-American community is described as being less likely to be vocal about issues, but changing as more young people grow up in the US. However, they are still experiencing discrimination and violence due to the pandemic, with Chinese-Americans being particularly affected.\n\nTwo Asians were stabbed and another was severely beaten in racially motivated incidents, highlighting the prevalence of racism and xenophobia.
