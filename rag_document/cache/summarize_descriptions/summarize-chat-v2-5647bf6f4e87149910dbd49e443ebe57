It has led to changes in business practices, including improved ventilation measures, and has correlated with a rise in anti-Asian hate crimes. The event has resulted in thousands of verbal, physical, and online attacks reported to the Stop AAPI Hate hotline.\n\nThe Pandemic has also driven an unprecedented level of organizing in the API community, leading to a rise in xenophobia and attacks against Asian Americans. It has led to increased concerns about safety and vulnerability for some individuals, such as Thao Lee and her family, and has resulted in fear, anger, and violence directed at Asian Americans.\n\nThe Pandemic is not the root cause of the surge in anti-Asian crimes, but it has contributed to the issue. It has also presented an opportunity for transformation and reconstruction of society. The event has required international cooperation and assistance, and has resulted in a significant death toll and widespread social, political, and economic disruption.\n\nThe Pandemic has been used by some politicians to spread biased sentiments and fuel hatred against Asian Americans.
