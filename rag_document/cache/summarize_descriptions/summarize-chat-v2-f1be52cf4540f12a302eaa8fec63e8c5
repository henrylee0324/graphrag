Additionally, Whiteness can refer to an idea or concept relevant to a specific context or activity. However, it is also important to recognize that Whiteness operates on multiple levels, including basic rights, values, beliefs, perspectives, and experiences, which are purported to be commonly shared by all but are actually only consistently afforded to white people.\n\nFurthermore, Whiteness can also be seen as a system of racial hierarchy that perpetuates racism and discrimination against Black and Indigenous people.
