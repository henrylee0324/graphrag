{"result": "Here is a comprehensive summary of the data:\n\n\"Low-wage workers in low-income households are particularly vulnerable to the economic impacts of COVID-19. They may need assistance to avoid loss of income that could deter them from self-isolating to contain the spread of the virus, which would also prevent them from seeking medical attention if they fall ill. Furthermore, these workers are at risk of being let go by employers when they cannot work due to their own sickness or the sickness of family members, highlighting the need for protection against the consequences of job loss. Overall, low-wage workers in low-income households require support to mitigate the economic and health impacts of COVID-19.\"", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
