{"result": "Here is a comprehensive summary of the data:\n\nThe Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has been actively involved in addressing hate crime incidents, particularly those targeting Asian Americans. According to the FBI, there is a likelihood that these incidents will surge across the US. The agency has emphasized the importance of protecting civil rights and investigating hate crimes, even during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe FBI has also warned about a dramatic increase in crimes against Asian Americans, attributing this surge to misinformation and fabrication surrounding the novel coronavirus being a Chinese threat.
