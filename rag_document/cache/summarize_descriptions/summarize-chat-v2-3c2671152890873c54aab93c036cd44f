{"result": "Here is a comprehensive summary of the data provided:\n\n\"MERCER\" has a population that is predominantly Asian American, with more than 10% of its residents identifying as such. This information is based on data from the U.S. Census Bureau, which reported this demographic breakdown as of 2019.\n\nIt's worth noting that while Mercer's population demographics are an important aspect of its identity, it's also important to consider the entity's mandate and approach. Initially, Mercer was tasked with observing and reporting, but over time, its latter instincts gained precedence, leading to a shift in its focus from mere observation to interaction and preparation.\n\nI hope this summary meets your requirements!
