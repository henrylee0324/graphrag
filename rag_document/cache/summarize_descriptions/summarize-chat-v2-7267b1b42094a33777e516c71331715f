In one instance, a 75-year-old Asian American woman defended herself against an attacker in San Francisco using a stick. In another incident, an Asian American woman was attacked and injured in Philadelphia. Additionally, there have been reports of attacks on Asian American women in midtown Manhattan, including one where the victim suffered serious injuries after being kicked to the ground while being subjected to anti-Asian insults.\n\nIn some cases, these attacks were perpetrated by individuals who used racial slurs or exhibited hate crimes. For example, Joseph Russo was accused of pushing an Asian American woman onto the sidewalk, and Jonathan Russo was involved in two separate incidents where he attacked Asian American women. In one of these incidents, a 64-year-old Asian American woman was pushed to the ground.\n\nThe attacks on Asian American women have also had a broader impact, with some victims expressing concern for their safety due to recent violent events against Asian Americans.
